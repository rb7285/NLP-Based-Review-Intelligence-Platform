🔍 RevIQ – NLP-Based Review Intelligence Platform
**📖 Project Overview
RevIQ is an interactive NLP-based dashboard designed to analyze customer reviews from platforms like Amazon. Using Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis techniques, this project helps decode how customers actually feel about products or services. As online reviews grow rapidly, extracting sentiment-based insights has become crucial for improving products, service quality, and brand trust.
This project uses real-world review data to build an intuitive tool that provides live sentiment insights, keyword highlights, and visual summaries — everything needed for businesses to understand their customers better.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Build a sentiment analysis engine that classifies customer reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
✅ Use NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and polarity scoring to understand sentiment and subjectivity.
✅ Create a lightweight, scalable dashboard using Streamlit that enables quick CSV uploads and instant review insights.
✅ Offer visual summaries such as word clouds, pie charts, and bar graphs to make the analysis more digestible for stakeholders.

🧠 Methodology
📥 Data Input: Accepts CSV files containing customer reviews (from Amazon or similar platforms).
🧹 Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares review text using NLP methods — stopword removal, lemmatization, tokenization.
🗂️ Sentiment Scoring: Uses TextBlob to extract sentiment polarity (positive-negative score) and subjectivity (opinion vs fact).
📊 Dashboard: Displays results through a simple web interface built with Streamlit, including:
Sentiment distribution
Word frequency analysis
Word cloud generation
Review stats and breakdowns

🔄 Real-Time Insights: Upload your file, and within seconds, you get a complete sentiment analysis report — no coding needed.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Plug-and-play interface — just upload your reviews CSV
✅ Real-time sentiment analysis using NLP
✅ Automatic review preprocessing and cleaning
✅ Keyword and topic extraction
✅ Visual dashboards: Pie Charts, Word Clouds, Polarity Graphs
✅ Clean and fast UI using Streamlit

🎯 Expected Outcomes
An efficient review analysis tool for businesses, product teams, or customer support.
Ability to analyze thousands of reviews in minutes to understand what customers are loving or complaining about.
A functional project demonstrating your knowledge in Python, NLP, and dashboarding — great for resumes, portfolios, and internships.
