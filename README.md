# 🔍 RevIQ – NLP-Based Review Intelligence Platform

## 📖 Project Overview
**RevIQ** is an interactive NLP dashboard that analyzes customer reviews (e.g., from Amazon) to uncover key sentiment insights. With the boom in online shopping, understanding real-time customer opinions is essential for businesses. This project processes review data to deliver live sentiment scores, keyword summaries, and visual insights that help teams make informed decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Build a sentiment analysis engine to classify reviews as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
- ✅ Apply NLP techniques (tokenization, lemmatization, polarity scoring) to extract meaningful insights.
- ✅ Design a fast, scalable dashboard using **Streamlit** for instant CSV uploads and results.
- ✅ Provide visual summaries (word clouds, sentiment pie charts, bar graphs) for decision-makers.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

- **📥 Data Input:** Upload CSV files containing customer reviews.
- **🧹 Text Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare text using NLP (stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization).
- **🗂️ Sentiment Analysis:** Use `TextBlob` to derive:
  - **Polarity** (how positive/negative)
  - **Subjectivity** (fact vs opinion)
- **📊 Dashboard Visualization:**
  - Sentiment distribution (pie chart)
  - Word frequency (bar chart)
  - Word clouds for each sentiment class
  - Key review statistics

- **🔄 Real-Time Processing:** Upload your review file and get an instant, auto-generated sentiment analysis report — no coding required.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ No-code, plug-and-play interface
- ✅ Real-time sentiment insights from review text
- ✅ Automatic text preprocessing pipeline
- ✅ Word cloud and keyword extraction
- ✅ Fast, clean UI built using **Streamlit**
- ✅ Works on any product review dataset in `.csv` format
