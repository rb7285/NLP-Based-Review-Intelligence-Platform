520238,B001EQ5IAG,A1SO1PGDNVMLXC,kalyson,49,49,5,"Great product!  From corn, not birch","If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best. It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol. But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects. If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar. If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste. Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste. If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste. This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar. You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia. It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter. You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it.  I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.",positive,2010-01-26

COCONUT (my favorite smell) OIL kept coming up, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've used Olive Oil and found it to be too heavy and it really doesn't smell that great in my opinion.  The day I got the Coconut Oil I put a few tablespoons in a dish, warmed it in the microwave (which I've now found out you shouldn't do, stovetop warming is better) I parted my hair in sections and then brushed the oil in my hair with a hair dye brush, wrapped my head in plastic wrap (attractive right) and let it sit for a couple of hours while I did housework.  When I washed out the oil it only took one shampooing, which surprised me (olive oil always took two) I conditioned and then dried my hair with a blow dryer and smoothed it out with my in-styler and let me tell you my hair was so smooth and silky and shiny! I was amazed! Now mind you my hair isn't in bad condition, not dry or frizzy, I do color it dark brown because I have to cover those grays.  I used to get some poof in the crown area, but after the coconut oil there is none.  I use it once a week and I've noticed that my hair is fuller as well, very happy with the product and the results!

427036,B001E95KP6,A2EB1IIJ50X3WR,Nittlenny,1,2,5,You Can See and Taste the Difference!,"Do you know what's inside your tea bag? Brands of tea that you buy in a supermarket usually have tea bags that you can't see through. Cut one open- what you'll find are crushed and powdered tea leaves that are meant to brew your cup of tea quickly- normally 15 to 30 seconds.<br /><br />If you buy loose tea you'll be getting whole tea leaves- leaves that take longer to ""open"" and brew, but which normally produce a tea that is a better quality and which tastes better.<br /><br />Might Leaf tea bags come individually sealed in see-through cellophane packets. The tea bags themselves are made of see-through thin woven silk, and inside are tea leaves that are a lot closer to loose tea than anything else you've seen in a bag. You have the convenience of a tea bag with the quality (almost!) of loose tea. If you're not ready for loose tea yet, try Mighty Leaf teas. Yes, they cost more than usual tea bags, but you'll be very pleased with the tea they make. If you like white tea, their White Orchard tea gives you an aromatic, mild, flavorful light-colored cup of tea. You can re-steep the tea bags 2 or 3 times, and if you do that the price per cup becomes very affordable.<br /><br />I used to laugh at the Great Depression stories of my relatives hanging up tea bags to dry on a clothes line.

From Mio, to Nuun, to Crystal Light, and the store brands, I've tried most of them.  This one sounded pretty interesting.  Upon receiving the bottle, I stuck it in my bag to take to work.  When I went to use it for the first time, I looked at the back to see how much to use.  I was quite surprised to find it needed to be refrigerated after opening.  Back home it went, where it could be refrigerated.<br /><br />I find the flavor to be good.  You can actually taste the pineapple, and maybe some banana (although there's not banana in the picture.)  Like most of these things, getting the mix can be tricky.  After a few attempts, I've figured it out.  I think I'm using more than the squirt per 8oz, but that's ok.<br /><br />I don't usually feel caffeine (unless I drink a lot) so I can't really tell if this would affect a normal person.  The price seems high, but I don't really know how much you get from 12 oz of mix, compared to a box of pre-measured powders.  If a squirt is half an ounce, this is about twice as expensive as Crystal Light.

It did not look too appetizing at first glance.  The dark chocolate coating was spotted over 50 percent with a tan color, not the deep dark chocolate color shown on the outer cover of the box.  About every third cookie had separated the cracker part from the creamy half.  And about a quarter of them sported cracked tops with the white showing through. Like everything else nowadays, the cookie is smaller than the original I remember.<br />So far, not too appetizing, but hey, I eat broken cookies all the time, however the spotted coating reminded me of candy that was improperly stored.<br />So I popped one in my mouth.<br />My first impression as I chewed a Mallomars cookie. A very sweet treat just like I remembered from years ago.  Despite the discoloration the chocolate flavor was acceptable but not that rich dark chocolate taste my mouth was watering for from the picture on the box.  The cracker portion was dry but soon combined with the marshmallow filling while chewing.  After three I found them too sweet to have more at one sitting.<br />Overall, the taste was a four star.

Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far.

No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me.",positive,2009-06-17

I on the other hand love to adulterate my coffee with cream, and especially flavored cream. It's not that don't enjoy black coffee--I do quite a bit--but that I also enjoy the robustness of coffee mingled with more subtle flavors. The best combinations are those which allow you to taste both the coffee and the added flavor, without one overpowering the other.<br /><br />This is my first exposure to Starbucks Natural Fusions, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to serve the coffee to a group of friends and see what we all thought of it (including my coffee-snob spouse!). The results were positive; everyone liked it, but certainly not rave reviews. My wife said ""I like it--for a flavored coffee it's not bad."" I thought it was tasty, just a hint of sweetness, and not overpowered with vanilla flavor. It did not have an oily feel like some bad flavored coffees I've run into in the past. Overall it was pleasant, tasty, and enjoyable, but perhaps not so good I'll be running out to the store to buy more. I'd give it a solid 3.5. I'll probably just go back to my usual Sumatra beans or Kona Blend, but this is a nice break from time to time.<br /><br />If you're a vanilla lover, or flavored coffee lover, I'd say it's certainly worth a try.

I read news reports on how coconut oil may help with Alzheimers, diabetes and diet so I thought I'd try them since I have issues with all of these in my family line.  I feel more mentally focused and alert since I've started taking them a week or so ago.  I definitely plan to continue to take the pills.<br /><br />They are large as many people have noted (see my photo uploaded with the quarter), but they are not any bigger than any other large vitamin.  The pills, like other vitamins, do have a slight smell if you stick your nose in the bottle.  But they have no taste, no after taste and no gross burps later.<br /><br />The bottle calls for 3 pills 3x a day.  9 seems pretty excessive for vitamins.  I'm taking 6 right now, 3 with my coffee in the morning and 3 with dinner since I usually only have 1 or 2 meals a day.<br /><br />I would note that taking these has loosened some things up, you know -- down there.

I thought it might be a food allergy.  After reading a lot of reviews, I tried Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry Food.<br /><br />Since we started Blue about 3 weeks ago these are some changes I've noticed:<br /><br />She eats EVERY BITE and licks her bowl clean. She never finished her ONE before she asked for more.  It lost its appetizing smell pretty quickly.<br /><br />She hasn't thrown up.<br /><br />She's 10 years old and slept almost all the time. After a few weeks of Blue, she's started making her hunting rounds like the old days, checking the walls and hide-y holes for geckos, bugs and whatnot.  Didn't find any, but she's on the lookout!<br /><br />She started initiating play-fights with my husband when he walks by.<br /><br />Last night she threw a toy mouse out of her bed and chased it around for 15 minutes.  No catnip was involved!  I keep finding her 3 mice in different places so she has been entertaining herself while we're away.<br /><br />The only change has been the Blue.  She's re-energized and engaged.  I thought she was bored, old, and sleeping her life away; who knew it was a nutrition problem?  Thanks BLUE BUFFALO for reviving and rejuvenating our sweet Kitty!<br /><br />update: 8/8/12<br /><br />When I first read Kaonick's review I laughed out loud, ""3. All of my kitties are SO SOFT now it's ridiculous"".  But now MY Kitty is ridiculously soft!  She's also put her weight back on since she was sick in March.  We've cut back on the amount we feed her at once and just give her  little meals several times a day and she's happy.

Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).

486092,B00008CQVA,A29JUMRL1US6YP,HTBK,12,14,5,Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",neutral,2010-07-04

I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar. I like stevia better though for quick dissolving e.g. for salad dressings and cooking enhancements because it disolves better in cold cooking and it's aftertaste is covered up, but for hot foods such as putting it in cocoa and coffee there is an aftertaste but not so with Xylitol. Also I like the crunchiness of sugar which Xylitol has, and really have enjoyed eating strawberries dipped in it,  not to mention cinnamon toast. I only wish that they could manufacture the product with a more finer texture like the consisteny of cane sugar. Xylitol makes a great maple syrup when heated with water and mixed with maple flavoring. It dissoves very well with heat, great for syrup for corn fritters,french toast, and pancakes. I do not put a lot of syrup on my fritters since I am a little leary of it being so harmful to dogs(are we all that different?). This is my only worry.

403480,B0054S0YTK,A27FREQMVHI4A3,M. Trowbridge,0,0,5,FANTASTIC!!!,"Never have I used vanilla beans until in the last two weeks.  I found a recipe for Vanilla Pear Jam and wanted to try it out.  After going to the grocery store and having sticker shock at the $15.00 for two beans price I did some research.  I learned that the main difference between grade A and grade B beans is the color of the husk of the bean and that the interior quality isn't really affected by the outer color.  The length of the bean can also be a determinant for grade B vs gourmet or grade A beans.<br /><br />Being skeptical and not wanting to spend money on a ton of beans before I found out if I even liked using vanilla beans I sucked up the $15.00 per two bean price and bought the two beans at the grocery store.  The jam was delicious!  The two store beans were a little dry but still pliable.  But they were not much longer than the six inches advertised for the B grade beans sold by Vanilla Products USA. I wanted to be able to make more jam and give it to friends but not at the price the grocery store was charging.<br /><br />Placed my order on a Wednesday night and had the beans arrive that Saturday.  Impressive shipping time.<br /><br />I then took one of the B grade beans and one of the near gourmet beans (included free as a bonus), slit both and removed the ""caviar"" from the center of each of the two beans.  The quantity of seeds between the two grades was basically equal.  The only reall aesthetic difference I saw was that the near gourmet beans were darker in color and seemed a little more pliable than the grade B beans which were distinctly more brown.<br /><br />I found a website (VanillaReview dot com) which seems to have some great information about vanilla beans to see just why, if the interior of the bean is basically the same, would you pay more for grade A or gourmet beans.  The only thing I found was that they look better in your cooking if your using the whole bean.  I can see and agree with that, if your someone familiar with vanilla beans. But in the small town I live in, I'm not going to be going to a fancy restaurant and my friends that come over thought it was great I was cooking with vanilla beans.<br /><br />We made a small ice cream freezer of vanilla bean ice cream tonight, using the two beans, one gourmet and one B grade that I had split earlier this morning.  The vanilla flavor was incredible.  We compared it to store brand vanilla bean ice cream we had in the freezer and there was no comparison, we like the home made vanilla bean version hands down.  The one thing we all noticed in using the newly delivered vanilla beans for the ice cream was that the vanilla seeds could be felt in your mouth when you let the ice cream melt there.  They gave the ice cream a different textural feeling but if you brushed them against your teeth they popped very much like I have heard that real caviar should.  Delicious.<br /><br />Would I make this purchase again.  ABSOLUTELY!!!

92349,B007TGDXMK,#oc-R1PJZHS0R7NSIU,R. Saylors,0,3,3,"Spoiled batch made me shake my head and say ""bleh!""; Very Strong Coffee","First the good:<br /><br />The lack of K-cup and packaging in small plastic bags allows for a one-way valve, which releases the gas that builds up around coffee while keeping air out, this is an awesome idea. Because of this you should NOT put the coffee into a zip-lock-bag, but instead keep it in its own plastic bag and use a paper-clip to keep it air-tight.<br /><br />Further, the lack of 'cup' for the K-cup allows the water to filter through the coffee in a more natural-way. This means that in order to make up for the lack of directional k-cup they use more grounds. More grounds is awesome because it avoids picking up the bitter parts of the coffee.  This perfected style of coffee brewing is why there is little in the way of bitter in the coffee.<br /><br />These are the two stars.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />It tastes like sipping petrochemicals. The danger of not burning the bean with a very dark-roast is that you get to taste more of the bean. The problem with these beans is that they taste like gasoline. All of the work and benefit of creating the most flavorful cup of coffee, which is what SFBay has done, is totally lost because the beans they use are not to my taste. I can only offer my own opinion of the matter, as taste is not an objective trait, whenever I drink the coffee it makes me shake my head and say ""bleh!""<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Despite how bad the coffee tasted I drank through the first package slowly; now I'm on to my second package. It is VERY strong coffee, but not rancid. I would revise up to four stars given the quality of coffee I'm getting now, but since I was clearly sent a rancid pack of coffee I have to drop it to three stars.",positive,2012-06-25

He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.

When NB put out their grain free Alpha Dog, I tried that out and was amazed at how my normally very smelly Boston Terrier suddenly didn't seem to have any gas at all.  This got me searching for reviews, where I discovered the NV's Instinct line was rated much higher than NB's Alpha dog.  When I discovered the Amazon subscriptions, and how inexpensive that makes it(relative to what I pay at the pet store for organic pet food), I decided to give NV another try.  For the first week, I mixed the last of the old food with the new to get him used to it.  He had diarrhea and the worst gas EVER for days.  Now it's been a week on just the NV food and the sickness has not stopped.  I though maybe he was suffering from seasonal allergies and that's why he seemed so blahhh lately.

There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.",positive,2012-02-16

I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners.  Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down.

Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a ""chewer."" Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball.

Since it is not processed like table salt all the nutrients in it from the ocean stay in the salt. This salt is actually good for you, just google sea salt for tons of articles on its health benefits. Now on top of that the Flower of the Ocean brand is just exquisite in taste. Just a little bit brings food to life, on chicken, mixed in some ground beef, soup, you name it, it really tastes great and awakens other flavors. Oh and as for the other reviewers crazy rant about the price, most companies list stuff at higher MSRP's and then have the correct price as the sale price. It's a tactic that's been going on for years. And in the  old Celtic Sea Salt catalog you actually had to pay that high MSRP unless you bought a membership from them, so that could be where they got there MSRP from. Anyway if you want an amazing healthy salt and are willing to pay a little extra for it. And remember a little goes a long way so the price isn't so bad in the long run.",positive,2010-09-22

280304,B000TGBULI,A3R1D7H3PIFONU,Michael Jandrok,2,2,5,Possibly the greatest soda EVER!,"Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.",positive,2008-09-13

Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan ""all the time"", then my dogs should be okay.

But it is the best to transform Tuna Helper into an ambrosial delight.  No other tuna works as well.<br /><br />Over the years I've developed my recipe for Tuna Helper Fettucine Alfredo.  Here are the changes and additions in a nutshell.<br /><br />1)  Use butter.<br /><br />2)  Substitute Half and Half for milk to impart a far richer flavor.<br /><br />3)  Add a dash of Tabasco when adding ingredients.<br /><br />4)  Add 1/2 cup dry vermouth (I prefer Martini & Rossi) just before covering the pan.  People living below 5000' elevation should cut the water by 1/2 cup.<br /><br />5)  Simmer; don't boil.  As the mixture cooks down, keep lowering the heat.  The noodles should become very soft and resemble a casserole.  If there's too much liquid remove the cover and increase the heat slighty.  But be careful.  A mild brown crustiness is excellent, but do be careful not to burn the noodles.<br /><br />Don't skimp on the tuna; use two cans.  I've tried three but that's too much.<br /><br />The emendations I've described work for other flavors of Tuna Helper as well but are most suited for the Fettucini Alfredo.<br /><br />Never use lumpy tuna for this.",positive,2011-11-11

Their precooked smoked turkey is excellent. But I did not enjoy this prime rib. Why? I bought the 4-5 lb roast for Christmas dinner. I let it thaw in the refrigerator for 4 days and then set it on the counter for two hours to bring it up to room temperature so it would reheat evenly. I followed the instructions that came with the roast, preheated the oven and let it cook for about an hour at 350 degrees. As I was busy preparing the rest of the meal I felt confident the prime rib would turn out fine since it was already cooked. As I was finishing up the rest of the cooking in that last dash of chaos to get everything out on time I finally checked the temperature of the meat and was shocked to find it was only 80 degrees in the center!<br /><br />I know for a fact the entire prime rib was thawed so there is no way it was still cold in the middle before I put it in the oven. I didn't panic. Since my guests were waiting and everything else was finished I had to get this meat up to temperature quickly (to at least warm) in the center without ruining the perfect red color of medium rare. Unfortunately that meant putting this beautiful and EXPENSIVE piece of meat in the microwave. I had to run it on high for 1 minute intervals, constantly opening and closing the door until I got the center to 110 or so - at least so my guests thought it was warmed through. Because of how big the roast was, that process took about 10 extra minutes. Obviously it is impossible to cook a prime rib evenly in the microwave so I ended up with overcooked ends, well done second and third slices and a slightly pink center.<br /><br />As for the taste...what were they thinking? I tasted like it was injected with highly concentrated au jus. Each bite was too salty for my taste and there was a heavy flavor of beef broth and rosemary. I wanted to taste the beef, not the seasonings. It reminded me a little of carved roast beef you get in a cheaper chain buffet restaurant or cafeteria like Golden Corral.<br /><br />Are there any positives? Yes, I can't say I hated it outright. The meat itself was tender as a prime rib should be and the flavor while a bit overpowering, was edible. In fact, my in-laws said they liked it a lot (but maybe they were just being nice). Also, it was much bigger than I thought - that's a good thing. It easily fed 6 people and there was enough left for another 5 or 6 more slices.<br /><br />But for the $115 I paid I probably could have had the same results from my grocery store meat case. Sorry Burgers. I like your products but you blew it on this one. I won't be buying a precooked prime rib from you again.",positive,2009-12-29

I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.

We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .",negative,2010-12-24

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

They are simple to prepare: just add boiling water and let sit for about 3 minutes (I prefer my noodles a bit softer and let them sit at least 5 minutes).  The bowls provide a generous amount of noodles to make a filling lunch.  The Spicy Chicken variety is my favorite so far (better than the Beef & Ginger).  The broth is fairly spicy but not too much for the average palate.  Along with the noodles, there are pieces of dehydrated vegetables as well as chicken pieces.  The chicken pieces taste ok but are spongy and look kind of disgusting; I have thought about picking them out before adding the water but haven't bothered.  As other reviewers have noted, the bowls are high in sodium; however, you can use less of the seasoning packet if that is a concern.  For the price, these noodle bowls are a real winner, and they have become a frequent work-time lunch for me.<br /><br />I should note that when I ordered then from here, the case was slightly crushed and about 1/3 of the bowls were somewhat smashed.  Fortunately, the bowls were not broken and did not leak; however, because they were uneven in depth, not all the noodles were submerged in water, so they cooked unevenly.  I'm sure Amazon would have allowed me to return the bowls, but it seemed like too much hassle.",positive,2011-04-15

I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle.

However, the overall unit is lightweight and flimsy.  The toy in the base intrigued them but unfortunately it's not a furry mouse as shown in the picture, but instead is (was) just a paper pom-pom.  Our smallest kitty had the toy in shreds by the end of the second day.  The base of the Kong scratcher is cardboard and the unit moves at the slightest touch, so you need to add extra weight in order to use it.  We bought the Bergan Turbo Cat Scratcher at the same time, and I'd recommend it over the Kong.  The Bergan model has a similar scratching mat and a heavy plastic base that stays in place.  And our kitties love pushing the ball around the track on the Bergan.  Overall, at around $12.00, the Bergan is more expensive but promises to last much longer.<br /><br />Update on 9/07/10:  Be aware that the refills that Amazon sells to accompany this Kong cat scratcher are too big for the base.  The only way to use them is to cut them down, which is a pretty messy process.  Meanwhile, our Bergan is still going strong.  (Their refills do fit their base.)",positive,2010-02-20

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.",positive,2011-10-06

There are 3.5 servings in the 6.7oz can and 280mg of salt per serving (listed as 10% of daily value, for just one serving... I ate almost the whole can, but I was hungry and they were tasty...) I wouldn't care so much, but it's not sea salt. (and even if it was, that's probably more salt than necessary) It's probably iodized sodium chloride (table salt), heavily processed and chemically stripped of all minerals.<br /><br />I allow canned fish in my diet because it is a good way to get omega 3's, especially while traveling or camping, but I am not so comfortable with the fact that the fish, while in the can, is brought to such high temperatures that it is considered sterile. Omega 3 fats are delicate, better to eat fish high in omega 3's raw, fermented, lightly seared, etc. Also concerned about leaching of the metal can. I only buy in water because I don't want to eat olive oil that has been so highly heated. It would be full of oxidized fat, but then again, maybe so is the fish after being canned. I am not so concerned with getting BPA free cans - They may take the BPA out and put in something just as bad or worse... a different bisphenol. I read someone saying the BPA was actually what kept the metals from leaching into the food. I think it was just their speculation based on tasting a metallic taste in a bpa free canned food, but it seems to me that could be the case.<br /><br />so what's worse, possible metals, bisphenol, and oxidized fats? or do the boost of omega 3 fats and protein, convenience, low cost, and lowest mercury content of any other fish outweigh these issues? (pcbs, dioxins are another matter and their levels depend where the fish come from) You must consider how much bisphenol, leaching metals, and oxidized fats you are getting in your diet already, and decide for yourself. You may want to get rid of all the other possible sources of these things and just allow yourself canned fish every once in a while.<br /><br />Ideally I would like to see on the can where the fish comes from and whether it is sustainably harvested. I also prefer spring water and sea salt or no salt.<br /><br />The wood smoking is another point of contention, because it forms carcinogenic compounds. However, wood smoking was done traditionally in healthy cultures, and is nowhere near as bad as charcoal smoking. Plus, it's really tasty.<br /><br />If you like canned fish for the low cost and also the health benefits, you might also buy a non oily fish head for very cheap and make fish stock which is extremely nourishing.<br /><br />I think I will stick to herring because it is so much more delicious than sardines. I can also buy wood smoked herring packaged in plastic in the refrigerated section for very low cost. It has regular old table salt :(, but I will give that a try too. Since it isn't canned I feel better about it.<br /><br />Didn't mean to give a lecture but there I went. As you can tell I've done a bit of thinking and research on this and maybe someone else can benefit from it.<br /><br />I think Crown Prince makes kipper snacks without salt so I will have to try those next.",positive,2012-06-11

I eat one every day for breakfast and often have another after dinner in place of dessert.<br /><br />While other breakfast bars are either too small to satify you until lunch or too caloric/sugary to justify their status as a ""health food,"" GoLean Crunchy caramel bars are substantial at 45 grams apiece and truly low-cal at 150 calories.<br /><br />Best of all, these bars do not taste like chemicals but, rather, like a healthy (high-fiber, high-protein) version of a chocolate-dipped rice krispie treat.  All GoLean Crunchy flavors are excellent, but the Peanut Butter and Almond versions pack a few more calories (180 and 170, respectively) than their caramel cousin.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by other breakfast bars that can't offer *both* good taste and low calories (there are plenty of ""healthy"" breakfast bars that run upwards of 300 calories each).

They're basically freeze-dried, so when you eat them, the moisture in your mouth makes them so they're almost like fresh strawberries (emphasis on the 'almost,' since there's really no substitute for fresh berries, of course).<br />Definitely agree with others that they can get a bit less crunchy if either left open for a while or not eaten relatively soon after opening, but I don't usually have that issue with this size container. When I get the larger size container, I empty the whole thing into a sealed Mason jar, and that works great to keep them perfectly crunchy.

The cinnamon taste wasn't overbearing, and it was great. It didn't have that overbearing corn taste either.<br /><br />Then they changed. Why? Money grubbing is one of the ways I would explain it. Why?<br /><br />1) They changed the size from 12 to 10 oz, like everyone else has done everywhere. (Notice that many major brand colas like coke and pepsi are changing to 1 liter to 1/4 smaller and raised the price.  It is important to realize a major factor here. Even though the media and government do not report any inflation, that is because they haved changed the very DEFINITION of inflation. All one has to do is go to the store to see this and the gas station. Look at BASICS like Milk. If people believe there is no ""inflation"", they just don't buy food. Coffee anyone?<br /><br />Yes I do not like it, but I see their reasons.<br /><br />2) They reduced the flavor significantly. Less cinnamon taste, starting to taste more like a corn cereal rather then the original reason I purchased it.<br /><br />So.... They reduced the amount you get, reduced the quality and primary ingredient you bought it for, and raised the price. That is inexcusable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, other cereals are doing the same thing, so we have to be VERY careful, read the labels carefully, the cost per ounce, etc. The bottom line also, if the kids don't like it, the price is too high, and you have to buy it more frequently. it is now off my list.

It is certainly pricy -- about 50 cents per bag when shipping is included. Yet you get an amazing colorful reusable tin (I keep these in wire racks on the backs of doors in the kitchen) and this company really excels with its innovative blends. You also don't get the hyper boost of caffeine -- it's just pure antioxidant power and flavor from the right fruit and herbal ingredients. The cardamom also helps settle your stomach and gives it kind of a chai edge. (You might want to add a dash of cinnamon too).

If you are searching for a new healthy fat to use in your meal preparations, in addition to the coconut oil you are already using, then Red Palm Oil is for you.  The bright orange color comes from the abundant caratinoids in the red palm fruit. It is also rich source of vitamin E, and CoQ10.<br /><br />It adds a wonderfully unique flavor to egg, meat, and fish dishes.  I typically like to blend red palm oil w/ coconut oil for pan frying salmon, or grilling meat or poultry.  It also works well in chili recipes.<br /><br />Red Palm Oil is difficult, if not impossible, to find in retail grocers, including the large, organic, health food grocer.<br /><br />Even though this oil is widely used throughout the world, being produced in countries such as, West Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South America, it must be a scarce import to the USA.  Why else would the price for this oil be so expensive?  When you add $10+ shipping cost to the $14+ retail cost, that's EXPENSIVE! for 16oz, relative to other healthy cooking fats like olive and coconut oil, or butter.<br /><br />I've tried both the Okonatur and Omni brands sold by Amazon, and while both are good, I prefer the Okonatur.  The Okonatur red palm oil seems to smoke during frying a little more readily than the Omni brand, which may be due to a different fatty acid profile, however, the flavor characteristics of the Okonatur are more pleasant to my palate.<br /><br />For price comparison purposes, I have purchased a 16oz jar of Okonatur Red Palm Oil for $18.99 retail (San Francisco, CA) That, vs the $28.00 it will cost on Amazon - not a difficult choice to make.<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy Online if you can't find it locally - but give red palm oil a try.",positive,2012-02-08

It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again.",neutral,2011-12-10

Alfalfa is one of the world's deepest roots plants absorbs many trace minerals and nutrients from the soil. It's root structure that can grow up to 20 ft. deep, letting it absorb minerals in the sub-soil that many plants can never reach. It also contains all essential amino acids and is a great source of Vitamins A, D E and K. The alfalfa leaf also contains:<br /><br />. Calcium- bone and tooth formation, muscle contractions, heartbeat.<br />. Phosphorus- needed for normal bone and tooth structure. Interrelated<br />with action of calcium and Vitamin D.

It is a great peanut-ty taste.  Until we made the switch to natural, unadulterated peanut butter, I never thought that it tasted much like peanut butter.  I liked it, but it wasn't really peanut-ty.  Once you know what real peanut butter tastes like (and perhaps get used to the lack of sugar) the common stuff like Jif just tastes like nothing.<br /><br />Anyway, what I like most about the Krema peanut butter (we get smooth) is that we can stir it, refrigerate it and it still stays spreadable.  Most of the other peanut butters I tried required refrigeration but then would end up being hard and impossible to spread.

Tea is not too bad, perhaps a bit bland, but not so weak as to warrent two bags per cup. Tea is no worse than Twinings or other mass market products, certainly drinkable and packets are portable and simple to use.  This is no where near the caliber of most loose teas.  One product I do recommend is Kusmi Anastasia tea.<br /><br />As a footnote, I would warn you against purchasing loose tea from Tea District.  I generally purchase by the pound and ordered a pound of tea before I was in dire need of a refill.  After it arrived I stored it in my dry cool basement until it was needed.  In the time it took me to finish my current batch, the tea district tea spoiled - the sealed mylar bag smelled of spoiled oranges or rotten feet or maybe both.  Tasted about as bad too.

Since they are made of popcorn, (and not potatos), they are better for one's over-all health -- especially one's eyes.  Potatos are,  (ssady : (  a STARCH, and no matter how much nutrition they contain, they still are loaded with carbohydrates, and starches..... :_(<br /><br />Aha - and Avast, there!  As here come the (very!) friendly ""Pirates"", who make ""Pirate's Booty"" snacks.  This particular flavour, AGED WHITE CHEDDAR, is totally scrumptious, besides giving the crunchiness that potato chip lovers crave! : )(People who list potato chips as their favourite snacks -- such as Diane Sawyer, (and me!) -- are reputed to show a personality that wants to TAKE CHARGE!  Yep -- potato chip lovers are the natural leaders of the world, those who crave power!<br />I know that both I -- and I'm sure Ms. Sawyer -- want power so that we can do GOOD things for the rest of humanity, abd why not?  (Don't kid yourself -- there ARE, and HAVE BEEN such people, throughout history.  THEODORA, once a slave and then wife of Emporer Justinian was one.  With her power, she wanted to HELP the poor of Byzantium.<br />Really!  Of course, the born aristocrats didn't like THAT too<br />much!  Or, THE GREAT of Russia, who worked alongside of workers to help build his palace!  And J.F.K. Jr, (and Sr?) who belonged to the 'ROBIN HOOD SOCIETY', as well as OPRAH WINFREY, (I'm not sure that potato chips were/ are the favourite snack of JFK Jr., (or Senior), or of Ms. Winfrey -- but I'd take a bet on it),..as well<br />as....well.....DIANE SAWYER, whom I saw on TV saying that potato chips WERE her favourite snack, and....and...well, and hopefully, me, if I ever can find a way to get the wealth and power which my love of potato chips so clearly indicates!)<br /><br />Yet potato chip must, of course, be eaten with discretion, and not with abandon....or one's hope for a healthy life will also soon be....abandned.  PIRATE'S BOOTY, who's major ingredient is not potato chips, but much more healthy popcorn, (here topped with scrumptious aged white cheddar cheese -- also a carbohyrate and starch...but which here, as a topping, is, though one can definitely taste it('s yumminess), is not nearly as much of an ingredient as<br />potato chips have potatos!  For those who have heretofore only had<br />the caramel, Cracker-Jack type coated popcorn, the infinitely lighter, (though still totally scrumptious!) taste of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks will come as a revelation.  One can find oneself eating just as much of PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks, (especially THIS delightful aged cheddar flavour...at least for me!), as one heretofore did with potato chips!  Only -- much of the guilt is gone, because, ounce for ounce, these PIRATE'S BOOTY snacks are far, far healthier!<br /><br />And -- PLEASE don't think of ""nasty"" pirates, such as Peter Pan's Captain Hook, or the real-life Salesian Pirates, when you eat this wonderful snack.  Think of....Caotain Ballows, in the movie, ""The Crimson Pirate"", or Dr. Peter Blood, (played by Errol Flynn!), in the movie, ""Captain Blood"".  These are good, and HEROIC pirate figures...pirates who fought for freedom! (And who knows, but that SOME present, real-life ""pirates"", may someday soon do the same thing?)<br /><br />Althogh these snacks are NOT vegan, they ARE certified kosher.<br /><br />At any rate -- be sure to FREE yourself of needless calories,<br />and carbohydrates!  Have delicious PIRATE'S BOOTY Snacks, at least half the times you reach for potato chips!  As the Pirate's parrot might say: ""Awwwwk!  They're Goooooood!""",positive,2010-10-23

I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.

I've never had rendang so I can't say if it's authentic, but it did remind me of coconut curry with a bit of green curry taste.  Very clean and fresh.  I actually used pork tenderloin because it's what I had and it worked out very well and the meal came together very quickly.  I slightly browned the meat and then followed the directions, but added a bit more water than called for.  It still thickened up very nicely.<br /><br />There is plenty of sauce so adding veggies would work out well.  It comes with two packs, the curry paste/seasoning and the dehydrated coconut powder.  When I added the powder to the pot I figured it would clump up, but it mixed very smooth and perfectly.  It is a bit sweet, but it's also pretty spicy (at least for me).  I think if you find it too sweet you could add less of the coconut powder.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to buy this again.  So tasty. My whole family just loved it.",positive,2012-01-25

Sherwin,2,4,4,Great for the kid in all of us--but not the healthiest cereal...,"Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies taste great both in milk and as a snack with milk or any other beverage you like. Kids will love how the chocolate slowly turns the milk in the cereal bowl to chocolate milk, too! The cereal is reasonably priced and it comes with a good expiration date so it won't expire the minute it enters your household.  SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, this cereal is low in fat, offers no trans fats (HOORAY!), no cholesterol, and the 120 calories per serving is low, too. It's even ""Certified Kosher"" if that matters to you. Excellent!<br /><br />However, this cereal is not the most nutritious cereal you can buy; and for this reason I can only give it four stars. Yes, it is very low in fat, calories and cholesterol; and it doesn't have too many carbohydrates, either. Unfortunately, however, Cocoa Krispies does contain sodium and it just doesn't offer enough POW in the vitamin department. It has sugar; and sugar turns into fat if you eat enough of it. Be careful--there may be more fat than there would seem to be in this cereal!<br /><br />Overall, this breakfast cereal is understandably popular with children and it's great for the kid in all of us. It is low in fat and there is no cholesterol; there are no transfats either. The price is reasonable, too. However, it could be more nutritious. As breakfast cereals go, this one will certainly suffice. However, parents who want a highly nutritious breakfast cereal for their children will have to look further.",positive,2006-12-27

But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, ""nowhere close to my custom grind and French press."" But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other ""bold"" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel)  Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)",positive,2012-02-19

The very mild notes of vanilla, chocolate, and spices don't in any way overwhelm the black tea. Instead, they mellow and complement it.
