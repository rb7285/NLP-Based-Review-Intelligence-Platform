       "'Both of my dogs prefer this one over many other ones I\\'ve tried. The small bites are perfect for their size. I\\'ve bought this one many times and have been pretty pleased with the consistency. I now use Agave Nectar Light exclusively as a substitute for cane sugar. It dissolves quickly in hot or cold liquids and can be used in cooking. The Light Nectar does not have a distinct taste which I like. Only wish I knew what the long term side effects, if any, might be for continued use.<br />Guess obesity might be a side effect if you use too much. tangy ginger flavor - very pleasing to the senses; only takes a small amount to make a delicious cup of hot tea or iced tea in a pitcher for the refrigerator Ended up with a case of the Stephen\\'s chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen\\'s French Vanilla<br />\"cocoa.\"  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon\\'s price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen\\'s Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don\\'t like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~ I shopped a little to find the best price for these treats for my dog. This was the best I found, and with free shipping, it was even better than going to the petstores in my neighborhood! I will preface this review with the fact that I\\'m a novice when it comes to fondant.<br /><br />With that being said, my husband and I resorted to doing cupcakes for our son\\'s birthday party after we realized that no bakery around us made Pokemon themed anything.  After watching \"Cake Boss\" and \"Ace of Cakes\" a couple of times, I have to admit I was a little hesitant to even try working with fondant.  However, my husband and I found working with Fondarific relatively easy.  The coloring was exactly as it shown on the site.  It came with additional information with directions for working with hardened fondant, storage and shelf life after being opened.  I will say just a couple of seconds in the microwave does wonders for fondant.  Though it makes it a little bit sticky for a short period of time.<br /><br />End result......everything turned out great.  Everyone at the party thought they were professionally done. (Even had a couple of people ask my husband and I for our business card).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this fondant to anyone!!! Easy to work with and tastes great!!! This is a very silky feeling water.  I had to take a lot of medication and continue to since an automobile accident.  One of my medications really did a number on my stomach lining which in turn creates a lot of acid reflux on a normal day to day basis.  So I thought giving alkaline a try couldn\\'t hurt.  And it most certainly did not hurt.  It was nice not to have to take meds before and after meals. I was down to just one acid reflux pill a day.  Normally I end up taking one a hour before every meal and possibly one or two after meals.  I just took one in the evening and that was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />I would certainly buy this again.  Other members of my family liked the texture of the water too.  I sort of wish we could get in our five gallon jugs for the water cooler. My little eater isn\\'t picky, but the spinach, mango and pear is his favorite food of all.  The food is tasty, although it\\'s a little bit expensive at Amazon.  The grocery store and the big boxes tend to have this one a little bit cheaper.  Thankfully, Happy foods are becoming increasingly easy to find.  Good products and tasty foods = well, Happy Baby! I bought this item back in May for $30 (including shipping).  I have seen it increase, decrease, and now it is listed at over $60.  I don\\'t get it.  Last week it was $47 or so.  Well the product is great, but I would suggest trying to find it locally, because I am sure the \"free shipping\" is why this item has gone up so much in price. This is my second order of these treats.  My dog loves them, and I think they are good for her. I\\'ve been feeding this to my 7 year old collie for the last 6-7 months.  She has allergies and a vet recommended that I put her on a limited ingredient diet to help ease the symptoms.  She was originally prescribed a prescription Science Diet food made with fish.  For reasons I don\\'t remember, I stopped that and eventually ended up with this food.  At first, my dog LOVED it. But I\\'ve noticed that with the last two bags, she seems to have lost interest. On the second to last bag, I end up throwing out several cups of kibble because she\\'d let it sit there for an entire day (and she\\'s fed twice a day).  Though I store the food in a tupperware container, it seemed like my dog was snubbing it because it wasn\\'t fresh.  With the next bag, she excitedly ate the first few bowls... and now we\\'re back to the same thing. She\\'ll let it sit there for hours. I sometimes have to put treats in it just to get her to eat it. Maybe this food doesn\\'t keep well?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this kibble has a noticeable fish smell which is detectable on her breath.  Also, I\\'ve noticed in the last month or so that my dog has had TERRIBLE smelling gas. Maybe that\\'s just middle age catching up with her, but it\\'s got to be at least somewhat related to what she\\'s eating!<br /><br />So overall, I give this three stars.  My dog is one of the most food-motivated creatures you\\'ve ever met. Having food she won\\'t eat is just frustrating! This is a cookie as a child I have visit the factory and enjoyed going to the grocery to purchase them as a child. When they arrive I thought they were a bit small but who cares when I bit in to the good hard cookies still a great cookie owww cookie and coffee GREAT! So happy so many great memories and taste buds Excellent product! Fast and taste fantastic. As stated in another post the Borracho Beans are not for the faint of heart, they are spicy. This will become a staple in my pantry. You won\\'t go wrong with this popcorn. It taste great and you have everything you need. If you like your popcorn a little on the salty side I would suggest also including some popcorn & nut salt. It\\'s perfect on the popcorn and french fries. I\\'m on my second case of this popcorn and it\\'s as good as my first case. A++ I have been drinking this stuff for at least 10 years. I am from Europe and its very popular.<br /><br />It isn\\'t too sweet like other orange sodas, and it tastes amazing These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you\\'ve just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it\\'s not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it\\'s in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good. I normally pick up the RC Special 33 formula at my local pet food supply chain. However, prices keep creeping up and now they want $29 (before tax) for a 7 pound bag. So this month, I ordered Royal Canin via Amazon, and also grabbed a bag of RC Indoor 27. I am saving $8 or $9 on each bag and it\\'s being delivered to my front door! All my cats gobble up the Special 33 (higher fat content than Indoor 27), originally intended for my vomit-breakfast cat, Sage. Generally, Sage does not toss her cookies after eating Special 33. But it always helps to give her Halo wet food first to settle her tummy and then the kibble. However, there was a different problem with my Special 33 dry food order. The first night, the cats didn\\'t seem interested it in and left a lot on their plates. Odd. The next morning it was gone so they eventually ate it. Next night, I happened to be in the kitchen under bright lights when I noticed the kibble looked shiny and wet. I scooped up some in my hand and it was literally oil soaked. Somehow this particular batch had gone wrong. RC headquarters in Missouri told me it was probably due to how the food was stored or shipped (very hot or very cold temperatures) that made the injected oils seep out. Who knows. I\\'m thinking perhaps it stayed too long under the appetite enhancer spray machine at the factory (they do that, you know). I threw it out and Amazon happily and easily shipped me another bag. Keeping fingers crossed that this bag of Special 33 will be just fine.<br />Update May 2012: After buying several bags of Special 33 Royal Canin and verifying they were fine when I first opened them, after a day or two, the dry food again became slick and overly moist. I have determined that the food is just fine but it is altered by exposure to air somehow. My kitchen is not too warm nor too cold so I don\\'t understand why the formula changes. One of the ingredients must pull in moisture, sort of like the latest and most expensive women\\'s anti-aging creams that hydrate. my italian greyhounds loves these greenies for their teeth and have used them for several years as they are very prone to cavities. They are 8 years old now While generally a fan of edamame and wasabi, I found the seasoning of these beans uneven and dangerous. The occasional powerful bean was fun, until I ate one more concentrated than any mouthful of western wasabi or capsascin I had ever had. It was beyond unpalatable - to the point I gagged uncontrollably and had to spit out the beans, leaving a trail of fire out of my mouth. As colorful as that sounds, it is not an exaggeration. It\\'s been five minutes and the burn sensation lingers. Not enjoyable. I had to throw out the bag due to the negative association. Eat with caution, especially while driving. These PB2 products are definitely a low calorie alternative if you are willing to give up some of the flavor and texture that you get with original PB. I wasn\\'t a big fan of the regular PB flavor as it was just too different for me from regular PB, and I only used reduced fat PB normally as well. I enjoyed the chocolate flavor a bit better than the regular.<br /><br />Also, it should be noted that because you mix 2 tablespoons of the powder with a tablespoon of water, this actually creates probably half of a jar of PB in the end so this regular sized PB jars go much more quickly.<br /><br />All in all, I\\'m not sure I will be purchasing this product again. The grainy texture and difference in flavor, along with the fact that you have to do measuring and mixing to get your PB is just not worth it to me. I\\'ll take reduced fat PB. Amazon\\'s packaging really bad, Frst time I ordered this - no packaging or protection for product, arrived torn all to pieces and product damaged. I called Amazon, said they would send again properly. Same thing the second shipment, no packaging or protection, just thrown in the box, arrived ripped all to pieces, and product all over box. Don\\'t understand Amazon not caring how their product arrives..... These have to be one of the best cookies ever. They taste kinda like a saltine with chocolate, an awesome combination. EVERYONE who has tried them LOVED them! PAUL DOES IT AGAIN.  STARBUCKS EAT YOUR HEART OUT. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE STRONG FLAVORS OF STARBUCKS LIKE COFFEE TRY SOMETHING MILDER.  FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE A K MACHINE ---  JUST GET ONE.  TONS OF COFFEE AVAILABLE THRU AMAZON AND OTHER SITES AND EVEN AT YOUR LOCAL WALMART. I just received my crystallized ginger. Recently I made some gingerbread cupcakes, they were very nice, only I couldn\\'t taste the powdered ginger. The recipe had molasses in it, that\\'s all I could taste. I made some more cupcakes from the same recipe today, I added half a tin of this hoping the cakes would taste more gingery. It didn\\'t work very well, I still only tasted the molasses.<br /><br />This ginger tastes very nice on its own like candy. I\\'m sure if I use it in baking with recipes without molasses, it will be more successful. Meanwhile I\\'m quite happy just nibbling on them. They taste good. I have a 50 lb retriever mix and she loves these bones for treats.  I have noticed no tarter build-up although I do brush her teeth 1-2 weekly.  Even so, I think these are helping.  For some reason, bone snacks like these are not something she normally likes to eat but these must taste really good to her because she gobbles them up!!  I do recommend them! I was excited about receiving decaf tea, but it tastes absolutely horrible!  I can\\'t even drink a full cup of it, I tried making it several different ways, but it is not good at all.  Just donated the unopened boxes of it to a food kitchen, I hope someone there enjoys it.  I love all different kinds of tea, but this was the worst I\\'ve ever had! This is a wonderful tea.  Even when I steeped it longer than the recommended 3 minutes (more like 6-7), it did not taste bitter.<br /><br />I really need a decaf tea so this is why I chose it.<br /><br />Highly recommended! We were given a Keurig coffee machine for a gift. We really like the ease and convenience of use, but the K-cups can be very expensive. I\\'ve done extensive comparison shopping, and this particular deal is the best I\\'ve found (in online or retail stores, and even different packs here on Amazon). There are not a lot of K-cup decaffeinated choices, but since I like hazelnut flavor, this is a good choice for me.<br /><br />This is a nice mild hazelnut decaf at a good price. Slightly less sweet than the Dunkin Donuts\\' version, Oregon Vanilla Chai Tea shares an otherwise similar taste, but at half the calories. I got hooked to the DD version about 5 years ago and went on a search for a similar product I could make at home. After sampling every other chai tea available, I can say with confidence that Oregon easily makes the best product. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is the high sugar content. In fact, sugar is the ingredient listed first on the ingredient list, which means there\\'s more sugar in this drink than anything else. Of course, it\\'s still less sugar than DD, but that\\'s my only reservation about the mix. These snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery. The taste resembles that of cottage cheese. A little under salted for my taste, but still great. Watch out for blobs of undissolved jalape&ntilde;o mix, you probably do not want to bite into those. Received product timely.  Upon opening product found weevil infestation. Put product in freezer to kill weevils.  Returning product would have been a nuisance. I love this protein mix. I find the taste amazing. I will definitely be purchasing this again.<br />I was surprised how fast mine came, even with the super saver shipping.<br /><br />I\\'ve been making it with:<br />2 Tablespoons Protein<br />1 Cup Coconut Milk<br />4 (1 oz) Almond Milk Ice Cubes<br />Small Banana.<br />Apricot.<br /><br />I would without a doubt recommend purchasing this. Buying from amazon is also the cheapest.<br />I looked at a few sites that also sold the 3 pound bag but it was always more. Growing up in a border town, my grandma used to give me Topo Chico instead of coke when I visited her in Mexico.  I grew up drinking it and when I moved to Austin I stopped b/c it was hard to find.  I am so glad that I am able to buy it locally now and I always buy 2 to 3 cases.  I love it with Buchanan; and it also makes GREAT mojitos if you add a little rum and some mint. Grapefruit juice with topo chico is a refreshing, non-alcoholic beverage and definitely great after a work out!  For a hangover, try topo chico with lime, salt and ice! ;) I was excited that I found this gummy candy was available on Amazon, I had a bag from Trader Joes and it was sooo good.  Unfortunately, when the Amazon order came in the gummy bears were all hard, dry and crusty.  Very dissappointed in Amazon....  There is no food return so I hope get some type of compensation....! We have been using this to make cinnamon popcorn.  The Pure Cinnamon Oil 4 oz. is perfectly strong and it is essential to follow directions or only add a couple of extra drops at a time to obtain your ultimate flavor level.<br />Now I am seeking a Vanilla extract in the same league as this Pure Cinnamon Oil 4 oz. Wooooow<br />I love this tea!  This is the product, that can be really good for the body: it possesses the antioxidant, and vitamins. In addition, it also tastes good. You must try this tea, and you will not be disappointed. The free sample of the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt Bar was just ok.  I was hoping for more of a contrast between the sweet chocolate and the salty nut taste, but I got more of a nutty and less chocolate taste.  Plus, it was very hard to chew - kind of like the hard, brittle consistency of peanut-brittle, which made me worry about chipping a tooth. My sister-inlaw was looking for a drink (caffine free) substitute for coffee.  We drank coffee flavored Postum and suggested she try it. When we went to buy, found that the company had discontinued.  After searching the internet we found Pero.  She loved it!  To her, it was better than drinking coffee.  We\\'ve decided to order some for ourselves. (Cannot find this product in stores) I guess the most appealing thing about this confection is the price: you get a lot candy for your dollar.<br /><br />The \"gummi\"ness is on the hard side much more than the soft.  More on the hard rubber side than the gel side of the gummi spectrum.<br /><br />The taste is okay.  It isn\\'t flavorless like some gummi candies, so that\\'s a plus.  It does have a vaguely dish-soap-like aftertaste, though, that I could really do without.<br /><br />All-in-all, So, the best part about this stuff is the value.  I don\\'t plan on buying it again, though. I love the bbq ones!!!! glad I ordered the variety pack, but I think bbq won over all of them. but they ALL are good Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don\\'t leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert. Tulsi Green tea has a great lavor and is good as iced tea as well. . citric acid goes great in vegetable pur&eacute;es,<br />acting as an additional antioxidant<br />(I also use rosemary herb and plenty of olive oil).<br />. citric acid is a great salt substitute:<br />it makes everything taste like orange juice,<br />-- even beans ! . kids will love it .<br />. it cuts through any undercooked green odors;<br />but it doesn\\'t mask seaweed well,<br />and it tastes sickly mixed with salt . This was one of the best extra-bold coffees that I have EVER had!  If you like Sumatran Reserve and Dark Magic, you\\'ll like this coffee even more.  I will definately buy more of this!! This is among the best chamomile tea I\\'ve ever drank.<br /><br />I typically avoid chamomile because I often find it to be bitter, even acidic. Argo\\'s chamomile has a rich, smooth flavor.<br /><br />While Argo recommends using a teaspoon or more per cup, I find you can get away with half that if you let the tea soak for an additional two minutes.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I love this coffee and have bought several boxes over the years.  It will be hard to get me to change.  Good flavor not too strong just right.  Fast shipping too. As a former Cincinnatian, I miss the Cinti. version of chili so much!  As a result, I was happy to find a canned version from the Skyline brand on Amazon (in fact, Skyline was always my favorite, although there are several other good chili restaurants in Cincinnati, including Gold Star and Empress).<br />  However, I was disappointed to find that the can contained very little beef and a good deal of flavored water!  It still had the fondly remembered aroma, but it needs a heck of a lot more substance to be more than a sad little ghost of the chili you would get in an actual Skyline restaurant in good ol\\' Zinzinnati. This Feline Pine is fantastic. There is no odor and it cleans up neatly. It just melds into a fine clump.  I use the big scoop you can get for free with their points program.  Finally there is hope for cat litter. This is a dense moist wonderful cake mix! There are several recipe variations on the package. I usually make the one with the sour cream. I also add 1/4 cup sugar to sweeten it up a bit. The key is to gently beat the mix together, don\\'t over mix! By far the most dense fabulous rich chocolatey yummy cake ever.<br /><br />I don\\'t know what the 1 star folks are talking about. This cake is SO good! You won\\'t realize it\\'s wheat free. Really. i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place. I dont know what to do with the whole 4 box, i wasnt even able to drink up the one single cup! We have a dog who doesn\\'t like to eat. He is 6 1/2 years old and is terribly skinny. We have bought dozens of different kinds of food to tempt him to eat. This is the only one we have found that he will actually eat day after day. It is moist and our dog seems to think it is delicious. This is a staple in our office. All love it! Product is consistent in taste and quality. Recommend it for an inexpensive snack for the office team. For some you will have to aquire a taste for the way these olives are cured. If you are willing to try it and hang in there it is well worth it though. These have already been prepared for you but you can still add your own olive oil and any other spices you may like to them. The flesh of these olives after being cured is meaty with a slight bitter to them. They play off the almonds very well. The almonds in this mixture are soft, smooth (almost creamy) and offset the slight bitter in the olive. I prefer to eat one or two olives and then follow up with an almond. You can even eat both simultaneously. The olives do have pits so be careful. Don\\'t just bite down into one or you may damage a tooth. Eat the flesh of the olive off of the pit. I prefer to add some of my own extra virgin olive oil but it is up to your individual taste. This would go great on an antipasta tray or served with some cheeses and maybe some wine. Buon Appetito! I do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was sinking me further into estrogen dominance.  Remembering that I had liked goat milk when I had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country.  I started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know, it was.  Yes it is not fresh straight from the goat milk, but being able to have it again has been a blessing.  Thank you Mayenberg for both the powdered and evaporated milk.  Thank you Amazon for offering it a price that is not breaking my purse. My husband, two very young daughters and I love this salt.  We won\\'t purchase anything but unrefined sea salt again!  We did find that it was impossible to use in our salt grinder, but that may have been somewhat related to the quality of our grinder.  We left the bag open to dry it out more and use it straight out of the bad to our complete satisfaction. Lemon Lift by Bigelow has been a favorite of mine for many years.  The foil packaging keeps the tea fresh. I have used many other oils for stove top popcorn and this is the best I have ever tasted.  It comes close to tasting like theater popcorn.  Further experimentation should improve that. I purchased this item for Valentines Day and I can\\'t wait to give them to the recipients. Each package ( there are 3) has 3 servings. I am sure they will be enjoyed very much. Maybe one of the 3 will share some with me. I don\\'t know if I got a \"bad\" batch or maybe just have odd standards of my own. Hmmm. I\\'m used to eating Sunsweet prunes, and they\\'re sweeter and softer than these organic ones.<br /><br />I like that these are not so sweet, but sometimes I find them a bit tough, and I wish I weren\\'t eating them straight from the bag but instead cooking them with oatmeal or something like that.<br /><br />I don\\'t use them for any real physical problem or challenge; I\\'ve always really liked prunes in general. My dad needs these for regularity, and I must say they\\'ve been really good for him. Better than the generic or Sunsweet ones we used to get for him. Dunno why that is, but it is.<br /><br />Anyway--solid four-star rating.<br /><br />Ooo, little tip--put a few in a food processor and mince them up, then use them as a spread on toasted whole wheat or whole grain bread. Yummy! We\\'ve enjoyed this special cooking product for many years because of the excellent taste and texture it provides when preparing various kinds of fish.  We\\'ve been frustrated for quite some time because our local sources no longer supply it.  Imagine my pleasant surprise to find that I can convenienty order it from Amazon (one of my most favorite mail order sources).  For years I\\'ve counted on Amazon for books, electronic items, and (more recently) cooking items and musical stuff.  Now I can/will add food items to that list. I can\\'t say enough goodness about this produc. The taste, texture is great for my toddler.  You do have to microwave it for a full minute then let it cool.  It sticks to itself so that your baby won\\'t make a mess when they feed themselves, I do fish out the chunks of chicken.  Plenty of peas and carrots to put my mind at ease.  Pack some in the car, in the house, ready to go, it\\'s the BEST for my picky little one. Especially nice since my kids don\\'t like/eat tomato-based meals. DO NOT add water. Kalamata olives are a mid eastern staple.  Here, in Brooklyn, they are a little expensive. I use them in salads and on homemade pizza\\'s and you can just nibble on them.  They came quickly and were packaged well.  What more is there to say? Help. I\\'m still confused. There are two Verona blends/packages. One seems to have 24 t discs for 19.98.  The other says 6.1 Oz and 24 t discs for 36.95. Can someone explain the difference for me? All Rapunzel Dark Chocolates are sweetened with their \"Rapadura\" Whole Unrefined Cane Sugar, unlike virtually all organic chocolate brands which use refined \"Raw Sugar\"  This full flavored and carmel-like sugar is the reduced whole syrup of the cane juice with its full content of mineral-rich molasses. Whole sugar imparts a deeper flavor to the chocolate that may take a little getting used to, but when done its superiority becomes absolutely apparent.  All refined sugars require the body to deplete its store of minerals to digest, thus making them essentially demineralizing to the bones and teeth.  Refined sugars also far more readily feed pathogens such as candida.  This chocolate is truly an outstanding and healthful food which maximinizes chocoloate\\'s tonic and health builing properties, once you try it other brands will seem cheap and inadequate.  Super Yum! The taste of this seasoning is not quite as intense as I expected. In terms of overall taste, I\\'d actually rate it 4.5 stars. It has a unique, herbal bouquet flavor that is somewhat mild. I must use a large amount of it to achieve the level of flavor I want on my veggies. It\\'s really great in stir-frys. Great, medium blend coffee at a decent price with prime eligibility! The taste is great when used with a smaller 8 oz. cup size but gets a little watery when used with the larger mug setting. Overall, one of my favorite k-cup blends. This is my favorite DRY soda. The cucumber soda is excellent. I also like the Vanilla Beam Lavender and Juniper, but this one is excellent! No more beers, just give me ones of these any day. Hickory is one of the top flavors when we asked US troops what they like.  They love the steak strips as they are a bit softer but very satisfying.  If being able to carry along a snack, and needing protein is part of your decision, this flavor in a steak strip cannot be beat !  You won\\'t go wrong on this item. This toy billed to keep dogs entertained for hours lasted my dog 20 min.<br /><br />Be very careful with this toy. My boy ended up swallowing a big piece which made him sick and resulted in a very expensive trip to the vet. Fortunately it did not cause a blockage, but I\\'m not taking the risk. I got a couple of bags of these snacks at a 5K expo, and thought, since they were free, I\\'d give them a try. I\\'m now addicted. They\\'re the perfect snack: lightly salted, slightly chocolaty, and, my favorite part, sesame seeds. Unfortunately, they don\\'t sell them anywhere near me. Fortunately, Amazon does. I bought the \"Light\" Agave Nector which is a thinner consistency (and dissolves faster) than honey and is also sweeter than honey.  I use the Agave in hot tea with creamer and for me it\\'s a better flavor than using honey.  However, for coffee I prefer the strong honey flavor against the acid though I do not mind the Agave sweetener in coffee occasionally- it\\'s still better than the flavor of plain sugar!  In foods such as oatmeal I will continue to use the \\'light\\' Agave nector as it does not take much to get the oatmeal sweeter (whereas it does take a fair amount of honey). Additionally, another reviewer mentioned the \\'Amber\\' tasting good in oatmeal too. Although I have not tried Agave Nector in baked goods or desserts I\\'m sure it would perform well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot compare prices/brands of Agave Nector as this is my first time purchasing Agave Nector but it seems comparable to the price of honey.  Agave is it\\'s own flavor and I have enjoyed switching between honey and Agave for coffee and tea; it\\'s nice to have variety for variety\\'s sake and I can see why some would prefer to continue purchasing Agave Nector as it is such a healthy sweetener. Since it takes less Agave liquid to sweeten things it\\'s a good buy since one would have to add more honey to get things sweet enough.<br /><br />I gave Agave Nector a 5 because I can see the creative potential in baking.  Adding the nector to whipped topping and/or adding to pancakes with fruit might be good--- an application you could not have attempted with honey alone! I found this snack at one of my local stores.  I brought them to work and everyone wanted some.  So I started buying them by the case and bringing them in for those who had no store close to them.  Than one day someone found your packages on line and since than I have sent thme to my sister in PHX and my friend as shipped them to her mom on John\\'s Island, SC.  I love the taste and the crunch and find that one serving is never enough.  I have and will continue to recommend this product to anyone looking for a \"bust of cruch\" in their mouth. I love India Tree popcorn and eat is all the time. However, this item arrived without shrink wrap or a factory seal. How do I know it wasn\\'t tampered with? I tossed it rather than take a chance. Although I usually use bouillon, I was fortunate in getting an opportunity to use the \"Better Than Bouillon\" which the family had begun using in recipes...Its only negatives are that it is in a glass container which must be recycled and it must be refrigerated once opened..its price is similar to that of Bouillon. 4/12/06  abj The Timothy\\'s is a very mild but good tasting smooth coffee.  I wouldn\\'t say it is my go to coffee (Donut House seems to be that one) but I do enjoy a cup of Timothy\\'s now and again. I am using a Senseo machine so this was a nice product to use it with.<br />The box is large and has a slot you can open at the bottom to get one bag at a time, like a dispenser.<br />The bags are individually wrapped in sealed envelops which can be a pain in a neck to tear open.<br />Taste wise, this coffee is the best testing I have ever tried with my Senseo machine.<br />On a side note, the coffee beans are not Jamaicans but Ethiopians. It is 100% Arabica.<br /><br />Every bag is thicker than the norm so it is large enough for a double coffee. These are yummy little sours, I love them! I can\\'t buy any more though, otherwise I\\'ll literally eat all 9 lbs. These mixes from Hodgson Mill always work. I use my bread machine alot in the winter and summer. This one works very well in the machine and makes a large loaf. My boyfriend and I have tried all types and brands of coffee lately, but Kicking Horse is definitely the best. The beans are nice and oily and it has a wonderful aroma and flavor. This is the best hot sauce I have ever tried. I agree with JP. Adds heat w/o changing flavor. Excellent stuff. Be careful! I am very pleased with my purchase. The item arrived very quickly, and is a very good value. This is my second purchase of this product. These bars are delicious.  They are made of fresh nuts and fruit and are held together with an invisible covering that makes the bar very firm and crunchy.<br />I loved them - they disappeared in just a few days.  The box of 8 bars was shipped with a heavier item and the bars were thrown around the box, but not damaged. Love this facial cleanser.  My skin tends to be oily and flaky.  I\\'m no longer shiny, and I\\'ve had no break outs at all since I started using it.  It takes off all my makeup without leaving my skin feeling tight and dry.  Even my skin tone is more even.  My face hasn\\'t looked this good since my pre-teen days.  Love it.  I\\'m never using anything else again. When you live in SW Florida on an island, you don\\'t find many options to purchase bulgur wheat.  So I was delighted to find it online at a good price. The only caveat I would give to new customers to bulgur is that the package recipe tells you to add twice the amount of liquid to wheat. I use a ratio of 1:1, which maintains the nice \\'chew\\' to the finished product; 2:1 and you have mush!<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052OOW3K\">Bob\\'s Red Mill Light Bulgur (ALA) Soft Wheat -- 28 oz</a> This product is NOT Chew-eez. It is a similar product but not the same. My dogs will not touch them. This robust, dark-roast coffee is the best that I\\'ve ever had. It is very smooth and delicious. I highly recommend it for anyone who truly enjoys a deep, rich cup of coffee. Came packaged accordingly, and very, very, very, very delicious!  This is a good product and it was packaged properly!  A+ If you want a tea that tastes great, sip after sip, and do not like sugar or fake sweetener, this is the tea for you. No artificial anything. Tastes best room temp. I bought as a lightning deal because I needed a good snack at work.  These are delicious. So far I am very happy with these pet food can covers.  Unlike my plastic lids that cracked, these are very flexible and I don\\'t think cracking will be a problem.  Theses lids fit two sizes of cans, my 13.6 ounce dog food cans and my 5.5 ounce Friskies cat food cans. My best friend came over three weeks ago and I had made Tabbouleh, but made with Quinoa instead of Bulgar. He loved it, in fact, everyone that I had try it was hooked. But then he mentioned that real Tabbouleh is made with Bulgar and that we should try that to see how it would work out... so he went on a quest and found this product on Amazon. I have to say, if I would have known that he was purchasing a product that all the ingredients was inclusive, this product would have never been purchased. Not to be offensive, but his is a product for people that are either lazy, non-cooks, on the run, or that just don\\'t care about their health. If you are going to make Tabbouleh, make it with FRESH ingredients.<br /><br />So, my friend ordered it... it came in two days and when opening the two boxes... yes, it was very nicely packaged, but even at that, two packs were broken and the content was all inside the box... not a big deal. but then is when I noticed that the product he (my friend) had ordered, was an all inclusive product. I cringed, and figured I would try it and give it a shot. If you like lemons... lots of lemons, you might enjoy this product. It was so bad, that I called amazon, told them I was highly dissatisfied and I was refunded the complete purchase price.<br /><br />This is a perfect example of a company processing ingredients together to make it easy for the consumer, but please do yourself a favor, if you are going to make and serve such a delicate dish, USE FRESH ingredients. This is a super food that should never be sold all inclusive. Ultimately, I think personal preference is going to play the main role in whether or not you will like Zipfizz over any other energy drink.  That said, here is what I have experienced<br /><br />Energy Boost<br />For me it gives a nice boost of energy, equivalent to a full cup of coffee.  It seems to last around 5 hours for me without a crash at the end.  I think this is where individuals will have the most variance, as caffeine reacts differently in different people depending on the product.  For example, I don\\'t like what a Diet Coke does to me but I like this.<br /><br />Flavor<br />The flavor is great because it is not overpowering and not to subtle either.  Since it is a mix, you can add more or less water to get the flavor you desire.  I have tried grape, orange, and lemonade.  Grape is my favorite, although an interesting twist on orange is to add a bit of vanilla creamer - it makes for a tasty Creamsicle flavored treat<br /><br />Zipfizz vs 5-hour energy<br />5-hour energy also has the desired energy boost for me, however, it tends to leave me with cotton mouth.  Zipfizz does not do that since it is mixed with water.  I prefer the added hydration.<br /><br />Lastly, often times I only use half of a canister with 16 oz of water.  This helps maximize the value of the product and for me only half of the canister is plenty of an energy boost. My dog loves these, but the fact that they come from China means I won\\'t order them again. China has a terrible safety record, and I prefer to order products made in the USA. There are companies here that make a similar product, so I have already ordered from them. This coffee has a wonderful aroma.  I usually don\\'t drink coffee with cream and sugar but I like this particular flavor better with a little cream and sugar. This is a great product; however, don\\'t do what I did.  Make sure to look for recipes specific to steel cut oatmeal.  My first coffee cake was a disaster because I substituted this for old-fashioned oatmeal.  The coffee cake could have broken someone\\'s teeth! :-)  Since then I\\'ve located some recipes to use that are specifically for steel cut oatmeal.  I\\'ll definitely buy this product again when we\\'re out.  Love it!!! One of my biggest pet peeves is over-packaging, so I gave the \"frustration free\" pods a shot. I like that there\\'s less waste to dump in landfills. However, the pods don\\'t work well in my Keurig. In order to brew, I have to push down on the handle until the cycle is done, otherwise, nothing happens. I really like the flavor of the coffee, but keeping it fresh is an issue, even though I store the pods in air-tight containers. I probably won\\'t buy coffee packaged this way in the future. Everyone here gave the Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice (Apple) a thumbs UP!  It was refreshing, not loaded with carbs!  Not too sweet!  Nice green apple flavor!  Nice size cans too!  If my teens will drink it, hey, I\\'m happy!  They loved it!  They did like the green apple better than the clementine..the clementine was a bit stronger tasting, but I liked it! Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good. I use two pods on the \"iced\" setting and it is SOOOO good. Even when diluted with ice it remains sweet and has a wonderful flavor. This is NOT lemonaid so if you\\'re expecting the crisp taste of lemonade, you will be disappointed. What it IS is the BEST lemon-twinged TEA I\\'ve ever had. And I live in the South, so I\\'ve HAD some good sweet teas! Don\\'t get me wrong, I REALLY wanted to love this as I had read so many great things about coconut water.  I was so excited when my order came.  I had some already in the fridge so it was cold.  After I had a great workout I went to grab my coconut water.  I was shocked at how disgusting the taste was.  I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven\\'t had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.  My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it.  Good luck! I got a box of Trio bars for quick sugar supply during work. They taste great, and servings are the perfect size for me (one per day, without getting too much calories).<br /><br />They are not messy in the sense that the bars do not stick to hands or surfaces. However one small annoyance is they are dry, causing spread of small chips, and a need to clean up the desk after eating. The tea is little bit expensive but its worth it, compared to other green teas available in the market. I really like the tea with little lemon and honey in it. I was looking for Kellog\\'s corn flakes when I found these.  I thought I\\'d try them since I couldn\\'t find Kellog\\'s.  I\\'m sooo glad that I did.  These corn flakes are terrific.  They have a wonderful flavor and the texture is excellent - not flimsy and whimpy like the Kellog\\'s.  These are the best corn flakes I\\'ve ever had. From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don\\'t recommend them. I can\\'t believe how fast this shipped!  Overkill on the packaging.  It\\'s only popcorn, it could have done without the packing peanuts and brown paper and a box with four covers.  Product does not match the picture, is it new and improved or is it old and outdated? The photo is for the 10 item package, not the 3.  Just be aware that amazon is using the wrong item in the photo. I\\'m a big fan of Tasty Bite and I\\'ve tried a lot of their offerings. This one is very good.. especially over rice. My disclaimer is that they were all tried over rice.  My absolute favorite is the Madras Lentils. (With or without rice) Than the Channa Masala and Punjab Eggplant. Beans Masala & Basmati Rice Ready Meal is also very good. The ones that I didn\\'t like sooo much were the Jaipur Vegetables, Vegetable Korma, and Kashmir Spinach.  I really wanted to like the Bombay Potatoes but even over a generous helping of rice it\\'s just too spicy, It has a good flavor but there\\'s just too much heat in the mix. As a little side note, it looks like Tasty Bite is in the process of changing their packaging from envelopes in boxes to just envelopes. Good for the environment but WOW! the edges will cut you up. I\\'m still nursing a good size cut  from simply turning the package over to read ingredients. Hopefully they work on the design a bit more. I love coffee that I buy locally and this product allows me to use it in my Keurig brewer.  Getting the lid on is a little challenging, but the end result is worth it.  This is the coolest find of mine this year!! So, for some god-awful reason, I opened one of the care packages I\\'d received and this was in there. I only ate it on a dare, and I am glad I did. It smells inticing and salty and one taste of it and I was hooked. It has the consistency of cream of wheat, except it felt like small bits of sand, and the beef flavor is just mildly infused. Now I am hooked and will probably order a bunch of it. In fact, I sure hope I\\'ll never have a child, because s/he isn\\'t going to be left with any food. I am eating it all! This is yummy mac & cheese... my kids love it! No, it\\'s not AS cheesy as kraft, but it is more natural! We always cook it for just 8minutes & make sure to mix up the sauce separately (or it won\\'t dissolve on the noodles). Works great with any type of milk (almond, coconut, cow, etc). I am not going to lie. I will give you the strait dope. These things are like crack.<br /><br />I will polish off about 4-5 pages of these EASILY in a day (hence the freshman 50! that I have gained!) lol.<br /><br />If you love these, I suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker. I usually wait to buy this at Woodman\\'s for 3/$1<br /><br />It is a great price and makes decent dough.  I usually make a pizza with it every couple weeks.  It can get a little soggy if it don\\'t take care to stretch it out thin on the pizza pan.  Also, if I have time I usually will let it sit for ~30 minutes instead of the ~5 minutes recommended on the directions. perfect and lucious added to chicken makes it taste like pheasant, easily.  would buy again any time.  very affordable came in easy to open container Although serving this to my cat makes me gag (I am a vegetarian), my cat loves it.  She is very picky and can not eat hard foods since she lost some of her teeth.  It seems to be hard to get in grocery stores, but I was very happy ordering it from Amazon.  They always have good prices and very good delivery times. I brought a box of these along on an overseas trip so that I could start the day with a reasonable cup of coffee before I left my hotel room. Very good for instant coffee. I purchased the Italian roast & will do so again. Not as good as my French press, but much more convenient when traveling. I truly love this product and always carry it with me when I travel.  My only complaint is the packaging used on the product which is sold at Costco, which contains 24 packets.  Short of a hacksaw, there\\'s no easy way to get it open.  The product inside makes it worthwhile, but come on, guys.  You advertise it as being a \\'green\\' product, but this package had to have used up at least one tree and some mighty tough plastic. I bought this for mother last Xmas at a local store.  She loved it and wanted more of this particular flavor.  The local merchant did not have it in stock, so I am happily buying it here. Very pleased with this product and have recommended it to other Gluten Free Users.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMEQ\">Pamela\\'s Products Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> I love good quality Vanilla!  I have not used this yet because I already have some on hand, but I have used the Rodelle Almond Extract and it is exceptional.  I\\'ve also use the Rodelle Dutch Cocoa, which is also quality.  I will definately order again. I am jumping on the bandwagon with all of those reviewers who said this coffee is weak. I am disappointed that the Marley name is on this. I used two of these pods to make two cups of coffee. Yuck! Not only did it taste terrible, but it was incredibly weak. From my standpoint, you would need to use a minimum of two of these per cup of coffee. And that would probably have to be demitasse size to have it taste worthwhile. There also was none of that wonderful coffee aroma that you get with a good coffee.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are no instructions on the box to tell you how much to use. I wasn\\'t sure if it was my drip coffeemaker or not, but my guess is that the water would have to soak like a teabag. This is a case where you have to sacrifice convenience and go with regular coffee grounds. Not recommended. I bought this off here for my husband who has been wanting Zagnuts for years and we can\\'t find them in any stores.  They were shipped quickly and he has been enjoying them ever since! Excellent! These snacks arrive every two months at our house from subscribe and save.  These are the only processed chip style food I bring into the house.  All natural, very tasty but not in-your-face with flavorings.  No nasty orange crap on fingers (and clothes). Both cats love it.  It is very dense adding water softens it up and allows you to easily sneak some extra water in your cats diet.  One of my cats throws up chicken or turkey based foods, so its nice having an alternative he likes is grain free and is good quality. I gave these buns to my brother in law as a gift. My sister said his eyes were as big as the buns when he saw his first hamburger on a bun in years. They said the wrapping was difficult to open but it kept the buns quite fresh. They BOTH loved the taste and she\\'s going to start shopping at Amazon for her gluten free products. Handy little tasty goodness for go-lunches for adults or grab something easy at home with coffee. Boxes arrived in good shape and bars are nicely moist. Expiration date is really good = middle of next year! Thanks Amazon. Caveat: As a vegetarian, I ate this dish prepared with tofu rather than beef. Maybe that mattered more with this sauce than it would with others. But it was OK, without any special or redeeming qualities. The preparation was certainly easy, though that 4/5 of a cup of water (with the instruction printed in 2 point type) stumped me...what measuring cup comes in fifths? I got out a magnifying glass to be sure that\\'s what they wanted. But the flavor just didn\\'t punch as I thought it should, and there was a vague chemical flavor way in the back that left me unimpressed. A bit of tang and hot, but I\\'ve had better mixes and far better sauces. Shared with my son and grandson, and their feelings were the same. I am addicted to these crackers. I used to get them at Costco but they stopped carrying them so I was so glad I was able to research and find them on Amazon!<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBNIME\">La Panzanella Rosemary Crocantini Box, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> Very happy with the quality and value of this peanut butter.  I dont really like that there is sugar added, but at least its not corn syrup or trans fat. A close friend who loves great food and seasonings introduced us to this seasoning, and we fell in love with it.  It takes fruit to a new level for your taste buds, and almost everything tastes better with the lime, chile pepper flavor.  It\\'s not too spicy for those who are not chile heads -- but gives food a \\'pop\\' and \\'zing\\' we like.<br />We had a casual evening with other friends and brought along our personal bottle for a dish we planned to share.  They flipped over Tajine too and immediately began trying to find it in their home state, Colorado!  After hearing that they had been unsuccessful, we shipped a small case to them as a surprise gift -- and it was a hit.  It keeps well in the pantry and is a delightful lift when slicing an apple for an afternoon snack.  Can you tell we like it? I bought these to pack into a party gift bag for my sons bday. As soon as the kids saw what was in the bags they all went directly for the balls leaving all candy and other things by the wayside. I even started giving the to all the adults and everyone was just bouncing away even as they left the party. These balls are the exact same as you would find in a vending machine. If your looking for these type of balls these are perfect. wow!!! this coffee has just the punch i was looking for.  I love starbucks but bucks is the key word.  Midnight magic gives me bang for far less the buck.  I love it and the rainforest espresso is also very good. I am the type of person that never tires of my favorites, so a 6 pack of Raisin Nut Bran cereal is right up my alley.  The boxes arrived in good condition with cereal that was fresh and delicious.  Love getting my fiber in a tasty way! It\\'s not frozen peanut M&M\\'s.  But if you like dark chocolate and almonds, this is the best I\\'ve found that has no sugar.  I have tried to eliminate sugar from my diet (I still get an ice cream now and then) and you just need a treat once in a while.  I like the almond bars, but one day I accidentally bought the bars with cherries, and to be honest I like those even better, though they do contain the sugar in the cherries. this is really good like others are saying just like the gas station ones. but alot cheaper I use two for a large togo cup<br />but again it is really good. I\\'ve tried a bunch of brands, and this is the best - the most tender and fresh ginger available. Strangely, despite all the extra packaging (and waste), Amazon makes it cheaper to buy it this way then in the 5-pack of larger canisters ($7/lb versus $9.30). They should lower the canister prices! My husband loves these, we had a hard time finding them, they are wonderful and yummy.  We received them a few days after we ordered them and were very delighted with this product. They were also a great value. My daughter, who is in preschool, loves these Happy Baby organic pouches-her tops flavor are the apple-cherry, pear, mango, banana kiwi.  They are perfect chilled and very nutrient dense.  Easy to throw in bag as the package is soft and BPA free. I thought I was buying a plant, not a kit to grow. Should have been clear about the product, and it did not even grow. It\\'s stronger than the regular ones but not as strong as I thought it would be... I love these! My boyfriend and I ate the whole box in a week. I just ordered more. They taste great and they are better for you than a lot of other fruit snacks. These taste more like cherry than strawberry because the flavor is subtle.  My nieces and nephews like to unroll them as they eat them slowly.  Great deal on Amazon when compared to drug and grocery store prices. Excellext product, great price. This paste has a distinct pistachio flavor. Tastes delicious in desserts; cakes, pastries, ice-cream and cookies. My cat is a pedigree Birman and she has a very fussy food palette. We feed her the most healthy and natural/organic packaged food for cats that we can find. She loves the Tiki Cat King Kamehameha product! I\\'d never stuffed sausage before last week when we decided to make a batch of boudin blanc to take to my mother-in-law. From reading elsewhere, I knew that even if these casings looked clean they should still be rinsed. This not only ensures their cleanliness but helps expand them, too, thus preventing the tears mentioned by another reviewer.<br /><br />The casings should be cleaned after soaking in warm water for 30 minutes. Cleaning is most easily done by inserting the end of a funnel -- or sausage stuffer attachment -- into one end and *slowly* running warm water through the entire length, unraveling and untwisting as needed. This should be performed at least twice.<br /><br />Since we\\'d known to do that, we had no problems whatsoever with these casings. The boudain turned out wonderfully, and I\\'m looking forward to making more! My son loves sour candy and requested a big tub of this for his birthday...so he wouldn\\'t run out.  Request granted and statisfied x 2. Our Hungarian family grew up on this salami. It arrived cold and ready to eat!  Brings back many happy memories sitting around with thin slices of salami on warm rye bread with crisp red peppers! If you love salami, you have to try the Hungarian Brand. If you love chocolate truffles and raspberries, you will love this coffee.  Flavors are not overbearing -- just enough to enhance the coffee.  The aroma while brewing is heavenly.  Enjoy. This is a huge deal. I will not begin to comment on how much this product would cost in the stores. If you have to have fried foods and are not allergic to nuts...this is a must have. With it\\'s phytosterol properties and vitamin E this is one of the better oils to fry with due to it being heart healthy and ability to help lower cholesterol. In addition, the flavor of this oil is light and not imposing. I\\'ve tried some of these bars, both getting a sampler from the manufacturer, and this box.  I like the bars, and they work for me as a diabetic.  I\\'m very glad that there are companies making products like this.  Unlike some others I do genuinely enjoy the taste.  But in the end I feel that at nearly $2/ea, they are pretty over-priced.  There are other products, like from Atkins and South Beach that are just as tasty and healthy, but much less expensive. Okay, I can\\'t even believe they sell Nutella on Amazon. This is absurdity! I typed \"Nutella\" in the search engine hoping to find a recipe book or something...but actual jars?? I\\'m laughing so hard right now that I had to write a review just to say that Nutella is worthy of a \"five-star rating.\" People say they eat this stuff with a spoon? Pfft, amateurs, I eat it with a ladle. Beat that, fatties. Oh and for the record in case you\\'re curious, there are a couple of recipe books on Amazon for Nutella. Yes, my cat loves this stuff. That\\'s besides the point. Really, this is not meant to be cat food. I put this on my rice, my ramen, my tofu, etc. and I eat it. This can also be boiled to make a fish stock, although it doesn\\'t really give a super strong stock unless you use a lot of the flakes. The flakes are very meaty, taste mild and very good. For those of you who don\\'t like fish, this isn\\'t for you. However, you probably have had bonito fish stock if you\\'ve had miso soup before. I love this stuff. I set aside a small batch for my cat because he loves it too and it\\'s a great treat for both of us that is not salty, preservative laden, or fatty.<br /><br />tl;dr: Great taste, can be used as a healthy alternative to cat treats, but it\\'s really meant for human consumption. Ingredients are listed in order from largest amounts to smallest amounts. In this illy issimo cappuccino, ingredients are listed as follows: coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan.<br /><br />I would have guessed this order: water, sugar, coffee, cocoa powder. And I would not have guessed milk or any of the other items. I like that it has only 100 calories. Label indicates Protein 4g and Calcium 10%, Total Fat 1.5 g (very good!), and Total Carb 19g (not so good for people on a low carb diet).<br /><br />This cappuccino was a nice late-afternoon energizer that motivated me to take a brisk one-mile walk. (Very good!) This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat\\'s head definitely doesn\\'t represent what\\'s in the food. I don\\'t think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is \"animal fat.\" It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it\\'s still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime. The perfect marmelade must have orange pieces, be thick, slightly sweet but with a lemony tang.  Mrs. Bridges Dundee Orange Marmelade is all that.  I\\'m ordering twelve more to give as presents. I sent this Eid gift to an out-of-town family member and got RAVES back, and I quote, \"This is the *best* chocolate I ever ate!!!!\"  Based on that reaction I am ordering it again for a second Eid.  : ) Product arrived on time and was well sealed. Product description was accurate and I would order from them again when I need a product. Love this coffee!  It is my everyday go to coffee when I want plain, non-flavored coffee.  I actually use one k-cup to make a medium and a small in a large coffee cup.  I find this strength perfect.  Amazon has the best price and I love the packaging of the 50-count package.  Recycle the one box--very little waste! Single note, strong tea. No discernible citrus taste which is usually typical of high grade Ceylon tea. I think I will stick to Peet\\'s \"Buddha Peak Ceylon\" loose leaf tea- now that is a great cup of Ceylon tea. Good Ceylon tea should be bright, citrusy and malty with balanced astringency.<br />None of which can be said for this tea. Overall, this an okay-ish everyday drinking tea. I am not re-ordering once I am through with my 3 boxes. Plus, calling the tea \"tea leaves\" is a misnomer. This is more like tea dust grade, the tea dust is so fine. That is why the fragrance/bouquet of the tea is almost non existent. This smoothie has a medicine-y taste to me and my boyfriend. It tastes good when you mix it with alcohol bc it takes away the pepto bismol taste but I got it specifically to drink something healthy so mixing it with alcohol defeats the purpose. I\\'ve been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn\\'t thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn\\'t? I mean they\\'re always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I\\'m glad she\\'s getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn\\'t buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we\\'re going to stick with this food for now. following through on a recommendation for Happy Hips was the best thing for my aging Fritz.  He\\'s so painfree & agile now.  I love the result & he does, too. I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know. Excellent product! I use it to make smoothies & peanut sauce for my Asian inspired dishes! I highly recommend this as a healthy alternative to regular peanut butter. The only downfall, it\\'s a bit pricey. However, well worth it. This might be one of the most liked dog treats, but my dog hated it.<br />She licked it, put it in her mouth, and spat it right out.<br />It smells really bad too. I had it in an airtight ziplock bag, but the smell was so strong, my whole car smelled like it the rest of the day.<br />I guess I\\'ll donate it to the shelter or something... I was wary about ordering online, but I\\'m glad I tried it.  This stuff is delicious and gives you lasting energy.  Highly recommend! have to disagree with the other reviewer. these sardines are large (usually 4 or 5 per can) and firm. they have a nice flavor without the overly \"fishy\" or \"oily\" textures of some of the other brands. within the varieties offered by Wild Planet, the plain XV olive oil ones are my favorite (the \"with lemon\" variety has a slice of lemon in the can that unfortunately, adds bitterness to the flavors without bringing a lot of \"lemon\" to the party - avoid). This was one of the best prices I could find for Gu.  I\\'m a long distance runner, so this stuff is a staple in my diet.  I ran a marathon last weekend and plowed through 5 in one day...  you have to shop around when you consume this much.<br /><br />The Vanilla flavor is my favorite.  The fruity ones are just a little too fake for my liking. Love the Green Mountain K-cups. I especially like the mountain blueberry flavor. The price was excellent. I have found many other brands that were a lot more expensive and didn\\'t taste as good. Don\\'t let the fake reviews fool you. My wife and i have been drinking this stuff for a month. No taste benefits and we haven\\'t noticed and health benefits. I love these tomatoes, the slightly roasty flavor is really nice is a tomatoes sauce. I thought the convienience and savings would make it worth it to order this as a subscribe and save , but when I went back to reorder, the price had tripled... Amazon should notify of these changes. They should also only offer items for subcribe and save that they can continue to offer at the same price and those that will also be available long term.... I recently gave up coffee, but still felt I needed a little boost first thing in the morning.  The nice spicy ginger tea is great for waking me up and love the lemon-ginger flavor.<br /><br />I like the convienence of using Subscribe and Save program so will always have the tea on hand.  Highly Recommend this tea! I was looking for a raw honey that I could afford and this is it. It\\'s crazy delicious and the flavor is intoxicating. I\\'ve never had raw honey before and I\\'m hooked. The consistency is creamy, the flavor is amazing. It tastes so different than regular honey, not quite sure how to explain it. I highly recommend this honey! The product is not quite what I expected based on the reviews and hype offered.  If it has even a hint of coconut flavor, it eludes me.  The texture is sort of like lard at room temperature.  No health benefits have been apparent after several weeks of use. I was hesistant about such a mixture but I want what\\'s best for my baby so I bought it.  It doesn\\'t look the most appetizing but my baby LOVED it!  This will be a constant food for him until he moves on to the next stage - love, love, love this brand! We bought this product in the past to ship to our daughter, who lives in China. Refried beans is one food item from home that she craves from time to time.  She can buy tortillas at an import store, but not the refried beans. Cans are too expensive to ship, so a dehydrated product is the perfect solution.<br /><br />Last time we bought a box to ship to her, we decided to taste the product ourselves.  We found that we agree with all the five-star ratings.  This stuff is good!  I was afraid that a dehydrated product would be finely powdered, and yield just pasty glop.  Much to my surprise, the product has good texture, comparable to canned refried beans.  This tastes much more like home-made beans than the canned version, however.<br /><br />We will be buying more for us!  Great product. This is the second box of Walkers Shortbread I have purchased, and I think it is the best shortbread around. So buttery and good. I will purchase more soon. Roland S&B sardines are the best you can buy and believe me,  I\\'ve tried them all.  ALSO....Amazon\\'s price is half what I had been paying. Doggie biscuits are made with Barley flour.  I was finding it difficult to find.  This site has it in quantity and at a great price.  The bonus is that I can us this flour for my own needs as well as those of my pup.  He does love his homemade biscuits! My daughter is now 2 and we have been buying Happy Baby product from Amazon since she was 6 months old. They almost always have the best price and best selection! These are the best portable snack for a active toddler! My daughter loves the taste and I love that it is a healthy snack. A added benefit I have found is that the extra fiber helps keep her digestive track in check. She has had constipation problems since around a year and these have been the key to keeping her comfortable. For the best price Join Amazon Mom and subscribe and save. Lifesaver for those of us who live in Very rural communities! Having a cup, soon to be two cups, of Fog Chaser from San Francisco Bay Coffee this morning. Very good. They call these \"OneCup\" but they work in Keurig brewers. Guessing this is a result of the k-cup patent or copyright, whatever it is, running out but wow, this is some good good coffee. I really like this product since I do alot of gluten-free baking for myself and my daughter and this replaces pretty much cup-for cup with wheat flour without too much finetuning.  I\\'ve had success with most recipes I\\'ve tried although I do make sure to add extra egg replacer or xantham gum to help with the \"stretchiness\" important in many baking endeavors.  The only down-side to this product ironically enough, is the bean flour in the mix, while it adds much of the good protein and fiber that are lost with many GF flours, it also adds a slightly weird flavor that is hard to describe to whatever it is you are baking.  It is easy to get used to and we have adjusted. Although I don\\'t eat much meat, I\\'m not a vegetarian.  I do enjoy chicken many ways, and the occasional beef entry.  My problem with food is carbohydrates and cravings that follow.  I have found adding this chia seeds do my diet effortless, and beneficial.  It certainly has many healthy factors to them being high in protein, antioxidants and a natural way to add fiber.  But they are perfect for help with losing weight and controlling appetite.  I added these to most everything, and not changed much about what I eat, and I have lost over 5 pounds, and have not finished one 14 oz bag.  I have added them to all cereals and oatmeal, muffin mixes, yogurt, pasta, even coated chicken with egg white and used the seeds as breading and baked... great!  You find you don\\'t eat as much, and enjoy food more.  Very filling.  If you simply used them in cereal and oatmeal, it\\'s a very beneficial way to start your day.  A great price. Especially using the subscription method. Besides the great taste of the product, the quality and appearance of the tea chest exceeded expectations. My wife was very pleased with the gift. We get a lot of compliments from our friends and family every time we take out our tea chest. We\\'ve refilled the box with other imported and domestic brands of tea and they fit perfectly in the box. Now, I would like to find a way to replace the fabric of the cover or change the logo without  damaging the box... The television commercials for Pepperidge Farm\\'s MILANO MELTS cookies really worked -- I couldn\\'t wait to buy a bag!  I\\'m a big fan of the original Milano cookies -- the cookies themselves are light, crispy, and perfectly paired with rich dark chocolate.  So what could go wrong with Milano cookies filled with dark, sumptuous chocolate creme?<br /><br />Well, MILANO MELTS are disappointing.  First, the cookie itself:  It\\'s sort of a \"double-thick\" Milano cookie, which means it lacks the lightness and the delicate crispness of the original Milanos.  It\\'s very hard around the edges, and the texture seems dense and unappetizing.  Then, there\\'s the \"dark chocolate creme\":  It just lacks the flavor of the chocolate on the original Milanos.  Additionally, there\\'s nowhere as much creme as you see in the TV commercials (or pictured on the package).  The creme is mostly located in one half of the cookie -- I took my first bite and wondered, \"where is the creme?\"  All I saw was a thin line of chocolate, which was tasteless buried inside that thick cookie.  There was more creme on the other side of the cookie, but it was nothing like what I was expecting.<br /><br />These are simply not as good as the original Milano cookies (which are wonderful).  This is an interesting-sounding idea that just didn\\'t pan out.  Stick to the original Milanos -- they will not disappoint. I don\\'t drink American teas so I special order them about once a year. I never tasted this brand before unlike teas made in the US you can actually smell the apple aroma, it\\'s a rich great tasting tea and I intend to buy it again.The price was very reasonable and it helps that it qualified for no shipping.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQC04G\">Stash Premium Apple Cinnamon Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> I\\'ve been feeding my dogs this canned food mixed in with their Organix kibble for about a year.  They are very healthy.  I have two 70 pound Goldendoodles, one with bilateral hip dysplasia.  I have fed them various food over the past five years and none seem to agree with them more than this Castor & Pollux.  One of my dogs has terrible gastric problems with gurgling and passing gas and he hasn\\'t experienced any of that eating this food.  I\\'m glad to be able to get it on Amazon. Saves me a lot of money compared to the pet store where I was buying it. Purchased this food specifically because it had pumpkin in it.  Pumpkin is recommended for laxative purposes in digesting hairballs.  (Just spent a few thousand dollars having a hairball surgically removed from my 1 year old kitten.  UGH!)  Of course I cannot tell if the food is helping with that particular problem, I can tell you what I like so far.  First of all it smells \\'normal\\'.  Not that nasty cat food smell.  Second, the top ingredients are all natural (real) foods.  You know, words I can pronounce.  The cat loves it, although since she\\'s still young she isn\\'t really that particular.  It has helped her digestive system in easing (not curing) constipation issues.  All in all I recommend it.  Only food I have found with the pumpkin plus it smells good and looks like what the name says it is. Holy cow this stuff is amazing. How can they even call it tea?  Tea is that boring, flavored water stuff.  This stuff?  Nothing close to boring.  My sister gave me some to try and I can\\'t get over how good it is.  It\\'s like eating some kind of sinfully, delicious dessert, only without all the bad, empty calories.  I add honey to it, but really- you don\\'t even need to add a sweetener.  It can stand alone.  This has the most heavenly aroma too.  But if you\\'re only so-so on cinnamon- BEWARE.  This has intoxicating amounts of cinnamon.  Delicious!  Now, where can I get some more... Zico\\'s taste is the best of all the pre-packaged young coconut water I\\'ve tried.  Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut, but this comes close to the flavor.  Don\\'t waste your time on canned coconunt water - it\\'s awful IMO.  Zico has a lower sugar content than the other brands I\\'ve sampled (14gms/serving vs. 20gms/seving).  It is isotonic, high in potassium and rich in electrolytes.  You can practically live on it!  If you have an upset stomach, it settles it immediately.  I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat.  Her potassium levels were very low.  She was able to drink this and keep it down.  It helped improve her postassium levels and settled her nausea.  A friend of my  9 yrs. old son\\'s had a \"tummy\" ache while we were at the state fair.  I happened to have a Zico in my purse and gave it to him.  He loved it.  His stomach ache ceased and we were able to enjoy our time at the fair. the auto ship is a terrific way to get hard to find dog food like Newman\\'s-- I can;t find it in my area at all, and it is all my elderly dog can eat with her IBS and preservative sensitivities.<br />  Easy and cost effective.  I only wrestle with the CO2 footprint on having it to be shipped :((  And am working on finding an offset for that. !! :) This is nice just to have in your pantry for those times you are out of milk and need some for baking, cooking, etc. It\\'s a fine powdered whole milk not powdered skim milk, so has a good whole milk flavor.  Also good to keep around if you are just one person or even two, who don\\'t drink much milk. If you need it for baking or whatever then you have it. This tea has a little hint of citrus which works well with a very sort of mild green tea taste. The green tea part is very understated and not as strong as say Tazo, and you don\\'t really notice the citrus until it\\'s past your tounge. Like I said, a nice change of pace for green tea. I first encountered brewers yeast when pregnant.  It kept coming up again and again as the perfect food based nutritional additive.  Since it is food based and not a suppliment, it is easily absorbed.  However, it is known for its unpleasent taste.  A serving is two heaping tablespoons, and at first I could not find something to mix it in that I liked well enough, so I gave up on it temporarily.  It kept coming up in my researches for a healthy pregnancy, and so returned to it and it has remained part of my daily routine.  The mix I found I like quite well is the two heaping tablespoons mixed into about 5oz of Pom pomagranite juice.  This mixture is actually quite pleasent.<br /><br />I have tried a few different brands, and I am fond of Twinlab for the more palitable taste and the balance of the B vitamins.  The \"subscribe and save\" deal on Amazon puts it at a very good price. Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we\\'d give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren\\'t good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do. I love cinnamon flavored gum so I was excited about this being a natural sugar free version.  It has great flavor but the flavor only lasts about 5 minutes and then it tastes like I\\'m just chewing a piece of wax. Also, the pieces are kind of small so I chew two pieces at a time in order to feel like I\\'m chewing a substantial enough piece of gum.  Probably won\\'t buy this again. great substitute for coffee. nice bitter taste, but smooth at the same time. love the slight buzz I get without the anxiety associated with coffee. lots of health benefits coming from the flavonoids in green tea. Very good healthy choice. My son loved it! When he was younger I used to mix rice cereal with it for additional nutrition. I lost nearly 20lbs by adding 4 Tbsp to my oatmeal in the morning. Dont cook them just add them on after cooking. Add to salads and smoothies too.<br /><br />This is a good buy and if you sign up for the subscriotion option you get them even cheaper with free shipping.<br /><br />Nothing suppresses appetite like high nutrition high protien whole raw and vegetable based food and few are better than hep seed hearts.<br /><br />Also, don\\'t let this scare you off.. but there is no better colon clemse than adding 4-6 Tbsp a day of hemp seed hearts to your diet. I am convinced that no \"colon clense\" product works better and that no other suppliment or food will make you more regular. Your body will likely flush at first and you may experience very loose stool for a while but your body will adjust.<br /><br />For full health benefits, better cleanout, and better sustained weight loss stop consuming drinks with added sugars, junk food, and sweets. If you need a sweet fix turn to fruit. Add more veggies to your diet, cut down on processed foods, and meats.<br /><br />Truly this IS a verifiable super food that will make a difference in your life.<br /><br />Here are two great recipes for you:<br /><br />Oatmeal<br /><br />1/3 cup intant oatmeal<br />1/4 cup chopped walnuts<br />1/4 cup to 1/3 cup raisins<br />Cook it<br />Then add 4tbsp hemp seed hearts<br />Milk or rice milk to preference<br />Do not cook the hemp seed hearts.<br />Do not add sugar. Use unsweetened dried fruit such as raisins for sweetness or add some chopped apple bits before cooking.<br />If you are accustomed to using suguat your taste will adjust after a while.<br /><br />Green smoothie<br /><br />1/2 to 2/4 apple for sweetness<br />1 cup or so fresh baby spinach<br />1/2 - 3/4 banana - I freeze peeled bananas so that it provides a cooler drink but unfrozen is good too.<br />1/2 avacado<br />1 cup rice milk<br />1-3Tbsp Hemp seed hearts. Start with 1 and work your way up to test your preference.<br /><br />If you are unaccustomed to green smoothies give this one a try. It tastes better than most other recipes and the nutrition is undeniable. If you want sweeter try adding more apple up to a whole. 3/4 to a whole apple and 3/4 to a whole or fresh frozen banana and an extra 1/2 cup added to the recipe will make more than enough for two.<br /><br />Also note that your body needs magnesium and phosphorus to properly assimilate calcium. Hemp seed hearts are an excelent source of these nutrients and many others including protien. We bought this bone to replace one like it we bought at PetsMart about 2 1/2 years ago.  Our dachshund mix who is very playful will gnaw on it, but most of all he wants us to grab one slobbery end of the bone and play tug of war with him.  We do that many times every day.  Finally after nearly 2 1/2 years, little pieces were coming off so we had to replace it.<br /><br />We took this new bone out of the package and tossed it to him and he took to it like it was the same bone.  It is nearly indestructible and the best toy we have found for our dog. I am, in general, not a fan of substitutes. It is just not how I am wired. That being said, however, I do understand the value of the concept. So even though I don\\'t drink something to replace something else.... I can, absolutely report, that Dandy Blend is delish!!!!!!  As a result of Acupuncture, I stopped drinking coffee. An awesome side effect of treatment. My body kept saying.... \"uh, no, coffee makes you feel like crap\". But I have been drinking a lot of strong black tea ( awesome Yorkshire Red). While it does not make me wired like coffee and completely trash my adrenals, I recognize the need to eliminate caffeine from my daily routine. I recently tried dandy blend (a cute sample package from the Community Acupuncture office here)<br /><br />I really like it. The flavor is rich and deep. I have tried it w/ cream and coconut milk. It holds its own with either mixer, as well as alone.<br /><br />And for anyone concerned w/ gluten? According to the manufacturer, it is FREE of gluten.<br /><br />From their own website [...]<br /><br />How Can There Be No Gluten if there is Barley and Rye?<br />This is the most frequently asked of all questions about Dandy Blend.<br /><br />Dandy Blend is made of the water-soluble extracts of five ingredients--three roots and two grains. The ingredients are roasted separately and them combined in prescribed proportions, placed into a vat, covered with hot water, and allowed to steep for a prescribed period of time. The water, with the soluble portions of all the components, is separated from the grounds and spray dried. The remaining fine brown powder left after the water is driven off is what becomes Dandy Blend. All the gluten and other water-insoluble substances are left behind in the grounds to be composted.<br /><br />Hence, there is no gluten in Dandy Blend. Goosefoot Acres periodically submits samples of Dandy Blend to Elisa Technologies Laboratory in Florida, one of the most respected gluten testing labs in the United States for analysis, and so far, every test has come back gluten-free. Click to see test results letter.<br /><br />Therefore, from the standpoint of containing gluten, Dandy Blend is safe for celiac sufferers and other gluten -intolerant individuals. Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: \"supreme\" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the \"supreme\" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully. This is an excellent pizza from Schwan\\'s!  It contains just the right mix of tasty meats, cheese and sauce on a terrific crust.  Great for a snack or meal for a hungry family....you better make a couple of them because the kids really dig in! January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn\\'t really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars. Ok, while I didn\\'t like this one as well as Davidson\\'s other peach offerings, I did think it was decent, and totally drinkable.  And this is coming from someone who doesn\\'t really like tea, but is trying to develop a taste for it.<br /><br />The overall taste of this tea is a bitterness slightly spiced.  I didn\\'t really taste the peach at all, but that was ok.  It was a good kind of bitterness, one that combined with the actual heat of the drink warmed you up and it was very calming.  The spices were hard to identify if you don\\'t look at the package, but they reminded me of winter and fall, and getting ready to settle into the harvest.  The same kind of spices you would find in a cookie.  Although the clove did really stand out.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this tea.  Organic black tea, organic orange peel, organic cinnamon and organic cloves with some natural flavor.  So almost everything was organic, which I wasn\\'t expecting, but was pleasantly surprised by.  I do have to say the orange peel surprised me, I would have never guessed it was in there.  But I was a little disappointed peach wasn\\'t actually listed, which is probably why I didn\\'t taste it.  And the one teabag was sufficient enough for a large mug of tea after steeping for several minutes.  I added no sweetener to the tea either.<br /><br />A nice tea by Davidson\\'s but not my favorite.  Still, the ingredients alone make it worth getting.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012 with hains brown gravy, and peas and corn and potatoes, you can make a great stew! or open a can and grab a slice and have a sandwich ! good stuff, good feeling knowing you are helping the animals by not eating them. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5R0Y\">Stash Premium Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />This is a very nice double Bergamot, if you don\\'t like Bergamot stay away, if you don\\'t like Earl Grey stay away<br />It\\'s heavy on the Bergamot people! That\\'s why they call it DOUBLE BERAMONT EARL GREY.<br /><br />The Upton Tea loose Extra Bergamot is a good alternative also.  But for the price this is a good one.  Loose, or in bags it\\'s a nice tea. These eggs changed my life. For many years, I hated eggs. Eggs made me literally sick to even look at. Oftentimes I would see an egg and consider ending my own life. Then one day, a brown package from Amazon.com arrived on my doorstep. I opened it to find a friend had ordered for me these perfectly ovular, smooth, pearly white eggs. I could immediately see that there was something special about them. Handling them as carefully as porcelain china, I carried them into my kitchen and hesitantly cracked one over my skillet. With a little milk, a pinch of salt and pepper, a sprinkle of cheese, and a touch of love, these small, simple eggs were without question the best things I have ever tasted in my life. I am literally addicted to these eggs. I eat at least one for every meal.<br /><br />Whoever would even consider writing a poor review of these eggs obviously has no palette and no intelligence whatsoever. They should truly consider reevaluating their life.<br /><br />Thank you, eggs.<br />And thank you, reader, for taking the time to listen to the inspiring story of how these eggs saved my culinary life and supplied me with enough protein to make it through the day. These are necessary in a sazerac. I would not, like another reviewer, replace Angostura bitters in my manhattans with this, however. They generally go well with cocktails that have absinthe in them. I like buying these in bulk as it they are easier to store in the box. Good product. Usually beats the price at my local stores. Both of my small breed dogs love their greenies treat and I like that it is good for their dental health,, Found this oatmeal many years ago at Trader Joe\\'s in So. Cal., but moved recently and am no longer near a T.J.  I like it because of it\\'s coarse texture and it\\'s not processed much. I enjoy drinking hot tea during the day.  I drink this tea without any sweeteners and it tastes good.  I have especially enjoy this tea during this cold winter. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1YA\">Grove Square Cappuccino Cups, French Vanilla, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> Very good. No need to add sugar. Great tasting for a quick hot beverage not coffee.  We have found that is it best to run a plain cup of water through the machine between coffer and cider but that is the only bad thing we have found.  We love the taste and I am going to order more before the price goes up. It reminded me of cheap Kool-Aid, and it took about seven shots to get anything that looked like tea, or tasted like it. By that time, the taste of lemon was just a tad too strong to really enjoy it. While the tea flavor was too fake tasting, the others might actually be alright. I\\'ll happily take my real sweet tea over this any day of the week. This is truly a great product and at a great price. Great product! I drink alot of this tea. Highly recommended. It didn\\'t work well for me in the microwave. Will not purchase a 2nd time. crispy, good flavor, seasoned just right but the amout of product per bag varied from barely enough (6 tablespoons) to almost overflowing. I cannot comment on price because this is not sold locally; however, I can comment on taste.  These are so simple to cook and healthy.  I found a really good lentil soup recipe to use these in. The chips are great, & the size is perfect for my work lunches. The price here is a little steep. I get mine at either wal mart or meijers. I can pick whatever flavors I like also. Like many have said, these cookies are really tasty.  I love the flavor.  I\\'m only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled.  The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked.  That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting.  I eat them with a spoon! They\\'d probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that.  I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela\\'s fixes the recipe so they don\\'t crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact). I\\'ve tried several of Pamela\\'s cookies and this is the only one that was COA (crumbs on arrival) :-) I just bought these for my daughter today at our local health food store and I was very skeptical, but now I\\'m addicted to these. I hate to say that I ate my daughter\\'s cookies but I did and will \"sadly\" have to go buy her some more tomorrow. I LOVE sweets but these are perfect, not too sweet but just perfect and you don\\'t have to feel horrible about eating them all! LOVE THEM! these crackers are delicious and are my new favorite #1 GF cracker beating out Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, Sesame Garlic, 5.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) as they are sturdier, larger, tastier and without soy! They are better to dip with and to eat plain right out of the box or top with cheeeeeeeeeeeeese please! I discovered them today at Sprouts Everything GF is 25% off Extravaganza for two dollars forty six cents per box or three bucks when not on sale also Whole Foods carries them for $3.69ea so I appreciate the Amazon subscriber savings - also saves me on gasoline. This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is \"coffee flavored coffee\", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you\\'re looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors. That might make you mad if you\\'re jonesing for that cup of coffee to wake up in the morning. I have a very picky Akita mix and buying treats for him is a major project: will he like them?; will he spit them out and give me a dirty look?  Fortunately, Murray loved these training treats.  Next time I order, I will be stocking up on these. I bought these mini bones for my 10 pound chug and he loved them, That is UNTIL he started choking on the bone.  The bones seem to crumble once bitten into , the pieces fit in the mouth and make it hard for them to chew.  When he tried to chew it it kept slipping and getting loged into his throat. Good thing I was home to watch him or he could have choked to death! Never will buy again. Love my dog too much to take chances.. Although the packing says DELUXE WHOLE cashews, this contains too many pieces of cashew. I think its because they stuffed everything in 1 pack.<br />I have purchased then at Target and smaller boxes are fine.<br />This one is no good. Great product.  It tastes fairly good and does give you a nice burst of energy to do what you need to do on a Wednesday (and Thursday) In the stressful world we live in it\\'s nice to relax with a warm cup of Natural Calm Magnesium at the end of the day - I get better results with this product than any magnesium pill I\\'ve tried.  My kids love it too and say it helps them fall asleep faster.  Arrived quick, and a better price than at the local store! Great deal! I didn\\'t read the candy count. lol. I had no idea I was buying 360 pieces of candy. Lol I ordered this Wissotzky Tea Box for a business associate (and close friend)who lives in another state.  Not only did it arrive early (thank you), but following is the email I received directly from my friend: \"The wooden box is beautiful and I am going to save it always for my tea-even when the tea runs out. It has a beautiful latch and hinges and great art work. It is perfect. I love the tea selection. I am going to use the tea and box for my Christmas brunch for my family.\"  It is so reassuring to send a gift (without seeing it) and know it will be a quality purchase. This product is great. Its got a few different ingredients than PB2 which are going to appeal to a big chunk of people in the health food community.<br /><br />PB2 is made with peanuts, sugar, and salt. This is made with organic peanuts, organic coconut sugar (which is supposed to have a lower glycemic index and for the record does not taste like coconut in the slightest), and sea-salt. I\\'m not certain how much the glycemic index of the sugar matters when it only has 2 grams of sugar per serving (PB2 has 1 gram), but then again I\\'m not diabetic and I thought it might be a useful thing to point out.<br /><br />Overall unless you are a strong subscriber to the \"Organic over Conventional\" debate I\\'m not sure this product is more nutritious than PB2. It has an extra gram of sugar and a gram less of protein and fiber per serving. Of course this is a huge improvement over normal organic peanut butter let alone peanut butter from any of the major brands. So if the two products are more or less the same nutrition wise purchasing would come down to flavor and price.<br /><br />This product is a bit more expensive than PB2. Thats probably due to the organic factor and scale. Organic ingredients cost more to produce and more to buy, but also PB2 has a jump start on branding and is in more stores (or at least it seems to be) so its distribution network may run more efficiently, it may be able to produce larger batches at lower costs, and overall its going to be a bit cheaper. So don\\'t write this product off now and forever because of the price. If you try it and like it support it and the price may come down.<br /><br />Finally flavor and texture. This product tastes like peanut butter there\\'s no getting around that. Its rich and almost creamy when you mix it up. It can add a peanut butter flavor to protein shakes, yogurt, muffins, cookies, etc. In short its fully customizable and how you use it is up to you and your preferences. I\\'ve read that a lot of people have to \"learn to like\" PB2. I didn\\'t have that experience, but if you did or are having trouble learning to like it give this one a try. I\\'m not sure what it is exactly maybe the coconut sugar (which again doesn\\'t taste like coconut), but it does taste a little different than PB2. I don\\'t have much of a preference either way and friends that have tried both seem more or less split in their opinions (when they have one).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />It tastes great<br />It can be used in many ways and mixed to any consistency<br />It uses organic ingredients and coconut sugar (unlike PB2)<br />But its nutritional stats aren\\'t quite as good (1 more gram sugar, 1 less gram fiber and protein)<br />Its a bit more expensive than PB2<br /><br />I love it, but you\\'ll have to decide how you weight organic ingredients vs nutrition stats vs price, in any case if you want to replace your normal PB but don\\'t like PB2 its worth a try I\\'ve tried a lot of different brands of sugarfree gum, but this has my favorite taste. Because it is bubblegum, it tends to stay soft longer than most other types of gum. Many sugarfree gums these days use sugar alcohol, and this one does, too, but though others have caused me digestive problems, this one doesn\\'t seem to. It has a mixture of sweeteners: sorbitol (sugar alcohol), mannitol (sugar alcohol), acesulfame K, and sucralose (the generic name for Splenda). There is controversy over artificial sweeteners, and some experts consider them dangerous to the health, so that is something to be aware of when chewing any sugarfree gum.<br /><br />It\\'s also important to note that sometimes people who chew a lot of gum with sugar alcohol develop symptoms that look and feel like IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Several different dentists have also warned me that it is bad for the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in your jaw to chew gum a lot. No better than the Pet Smart products.  When I got this for an additional discount it was a decent value (same price per pound as the other products).  However, it is 50% more.  I do believe that this type of litter is better. When it is less then ten dollars then I will be happy to purchase this on Amazon.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />This product is better than the PetSmart brand which is half the price.  Not way better, but better.  Sadly, I will have to deal with the extra aroma in the laundry area until this is 30% less.  Ten dollars about. I am dissapointed!! When I bought this product I thought I was buying the real Acai Tea. But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as \"Acai Tea\" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product. Lightly salted and delicious.  I like them alot. Very good quality product and packaging. Highly recommended. I will definitely be ordering more in the near future. Also fun to eat! I bought these for myself because of being on weight watchers and sometimes I want that salty snack.  My husband and friends who are not watching their weight also loved them. I is totally my fault, but buyer beware!! There are only 8 cups TOTAL for this!! That means that every cup of tea you brew is $2.50 not including shipping!!!!!! Horrible rip off!!! Must learn to be a better reader!!! I\\'ve purchased many different K-Cups over the last year or so that I\\'ve owned my Keuirg.  I was always looking for that smooth great cup of coffee.  Not too weak, not bitter, not smokey.  Tullys House Blend is smooth and rich.  It\\'s my \"go to\" coffee in the morning.  Ahhhhhh<br /><br />Amazon makes it a great deal purchasing through them.  I make sure I never run out.<br /><br />Love it! It has a wonderful light taste and you don\\'t need a whole lot of salt to season any of yor food which will cut down you daily salt intake ! I can\\'t really complain about a system that gives me peace of mind when I\\'m not at home.  My dog is 10 lbs and 11-months old.  I wouldn\\'t recommend this product if you have a dog that\\'s more than 30 pounds.  I would say a miniature spaniel or small cockerspaniel would be the top sized dog you\\'d want to use a litter box with.  But then again, if you have a large space like a connecting garage or a very large kitchen area and have space for an extra large tray, it could probably work too.<br /><br />Although I don\\'t use my litter box outdoors, I can see this as a useful potty aid if you don\\'t want your dog to mess up your outside garden area.  I\\'m thinking about adding a box outside because I don\\'t have a lawn, and it\\'s mostly concrete and dirt.<br /><br />My dog still enjoys his walks, and DOES go poop and pee outside in the park lawn whenever I take him.  He also goes inside his litter box, but it\\'s not as preferable for him.  He will still pee on my carpet when he\\'s roaming around and not near the litter box.  So my dog, even at 11 months old is not completely housebroken.  He\\'s not a very smart dog, so I don\\'t think he ever will be housebroken.  If you have a dog like mine, this might be your best solution.<br /><br />If I know that he has just eaten or drank a lot of water, I bring him back to the litter box after a couple of hours (which is in my laundry room) and close the door for a while or wait until he goes.  This is the only way to make sure he doesn\\'t have accidents.  If your dog is paper trained or pad trained, you should follow the \"transition\" instructions on the Purina website.  My dog has only used the litter box since birth, but when he discovered the lawn, he never quite liked the litter box as much.<br /><br />So here is the best way to use this litter.<br /><br />1.  Only line the bottom of the tray with a small layer, just enough to cover the bottom.  This will save you A LOT of litter and cash in your pocket.  The instructions wants you to put in at least an inch of pellets.  I found it very wasteful and heavy to pick up and clean as well.<br /><br />2.  The second most important reason why you want just a THIN layer is because it\\'s always best to replace your litter often.  This makes for less waste.<br /><br />3.  When your dog pees on the pellets, they swell up and you can tell which pellets have been soaked.  If you\\'re careful, you can use a small scooper to clean that portion out and replace it with fresh pellets.<br /><br />4.  Also clean up poop out of the litter box on a daily basis or as soon as your dog poops.  This will prevent a smelly room, and encourage your dog to go back in the litter box.  My dog barks when there\\'s poop in the box and tells me to clean it when he\\'s in his room at night.  (He literally drags me out of bed with his barking!)  I just use some toilet paper to pick it up, and flush the poop down the toilet.  This saves on biodegradable poop bags and again, puts a little cash back in your pocket.<br /><br />5.  If you bought the Petco Blue litter box tray, there\\'s some tricky placement to consider due to the foot ledge that sticks out.  Do read my review on the Petco blue litter box tray or remember these tips:<br /><br />a.  NEVER put the box flush against the wall.  This won\\'t allow your dog ample space to roam around the litter box before it actually pees or poops.  This will limit the number of accidents outside of the box.  Also, if you have a male dog with a marking problem, you will see lots of urine on the floor next to the wall.<br /><br />b.  Face the foot ledge toward the wall, (if your room is narrow and long like a laundry room...this is where we put our tray) and leave some space between the foot ledge and the wall for your dog to walk around.<br /><br />c.  Be prepared to sop up pee on the foot ledge.  This will be a common place for your dog to have a pee or poop accident.  Still...better on the ledge than on the floor.  The blue raised circles on the foot ledge makes it difficult to clean urine.  I have to fold up my paper towels and sop around the circles.<br /><br />d.  Always use a doggie cleaner on the foot ledge after you clean up an accident on the foot ledge.  Your room will start to smell if you don\\'t.<br /><br />e.  If you don\\'t want to struggle with this seemingly difficult foot ledge, try the actual PURINA tray.  I think the trick is to have a high edge around the tray, so the dog is not tempted to be partially outside the tray when it is going pee or poop.<br /><br />f.  Wash your tray every week or at least every two weeks.  No matter how often you empty your pellets, the smell still gets on the tray itself.  There just isn\\'t a perfect sanitary system.  I guess not having a dog is the perfect sanitary system!  :-)<br /><br />6.  Pellet bags are heavy...especially the 25 pound bag.  I bought a plastic bowl to help me scoop the pellets out and control the amount that goes in the tray.  No one wants to scoop the pellets BACK into the bag from a dirty tray after the fact.  Get the scooper...it will actually save you money by controlling the amount of pellets that go into the tray, AND your back in the long run.<br /><br />7.  To avoid your dog from chewing on the pellets, especially in the wee morning hours when it starts to get hungry, leave some treats around his room a night.  Be prepared to sweep up pellets on occasion.  A bored and hungry dog, makes for a naughty dog.<br /><br />8.  If you are transitioning your dog, make sure you put some of his urine soaked pads or newspapers inside the box so he can smell it in the early stages.  Your dog should adjust in about a week or two.<br /><br />Good Luck! I am not a salt-loving person, but this salt is so tasty and it definitely stands out from the crowd. I\\'ve tried other sea salts, since I can\\'t seem to find this one at the store anymore, but I\\'ve yet to find another one with the great flavor that this one has. The cost may be a bit high for the amount of salt you get, but sometimes you just have to pay more for greatness. Although not as good as fresh brewed coffee this comes fairly close. I use at the office since it much more convenient. After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don\\'t know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I\\'m going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don\\'t know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn\\'t want them. Bought these for my mom, who eats them (and the regular Nutri-Grain Bars) every morning. Needless to say, she loves them. But she just wishes Kellogg\\'s hadn\\'t discontinued the other yogurt bars. I grew up eating these beans there one of my favorites.If you like baked beans i definately recommend B&M beans.Not to mention they have a variety of flavors. These are not as good at Houston\\'s Samba Grill but they tasted great. The texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis, I have found something that I can make. I would surely recommend these to anyonr. I\\'m not quite sure why this product listing is for the chicken variety yet in the product description it speaks of how the beef version is made. That\\'s a little confusing and makes me wonder about the chicken version...which is what I\\'m here to review. Trust me, the chicken variety is where it\\'s at!<br /><br />This potent, endlessly pleasing box of feline ambrosia is the closest thing to opium I could imagine rewarding my cats with, without travelling over to the Middle East to get the real deal. Be warned: your kitty will take to this treat like the most ravenous furry addict you have ever seen, never missing an opportunity to spy on you as you open the refrigerator to once in a while (when you\\'re not spending inordinate amounts of time with your cat) get sustenance for yourself. If you\\'ve never wondered what it is like to marvel at a cat trying to open a refrigerator door, don\\'t buy this stuff. Don\\'t even think of returning to simple store-bought crunchy treats after this stuff. Your cat will look at you like you are trying to replace sushi with a gold fish cracker! \"C\\'mon, human, give me the goods; give me the white lines, I mean CRUMBS!\"<br /><br />If you drop a little piece on the floor, your animals will race to lap it up and transport themselves into \"Blissful.\" It is the ultimate reward with very few negative side effects as far as I can tell (other than unbridled, but functional addiction!)<br /><br />This stuff is a magical, mysterious little concoction that puts an instant smile on your feline and makes her your friend for life. It will slowly start wrecking your monthly budget, of course, but you will find justification after justification for purchasing it ad infinitum.<br /><br />I believe that William S. Burroughs, in the seminal novel Naked Lunch, spoke of the \"algebra of need.\" As soon as your fluffy little angel hits this chicken-laced pleasure pipe, she\\'ll be hooked for life! In the morning that I have to be on time and out of the house in a hurry, I use the Via and it tastes just like brewed coffee.  I am never without it.  My niece got me hooked on the Via.  Love it!!! The Organic Hibiscus tea from Davidson\\'s Teas is excellent.  Have really enjoyed hot or cold. I received this tea as a birthday gift.  I generally don\\'t like teas with \"odd\" flavors-- I don\\'t like stuff like cinnamon, lemon, rose hips, or orange rind in my tea.  This was just lovely.  The smell and flavor is light and pleasant, and the tea bags were of a nice quality.  I recommend this tea! I really like this soup.  It is mild and I don\\'t like anything that is to hot.  IT is just right.  Has a good flavor and is something I can take to work and pop in the microwave. I would buy it again and again. WELL\", THE PLANT MADE IT OK ,BUT IT WASNT FULL ON TOP LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE..<br />IT MAY BE AN OLDER PLAN TALL THE FULLNESS WAS IN THE VINES THEY WERE A GOOD 2 FOOT LONG OR MORE BUT THEY WERE JUST INTERMINGLED REALLY BAD..<br />I HAD HOPED IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED BETTER THEN IT DID ; AND BROKE MY HEART TO HAVE TO CUT IT BACK AND INTWINE THE SHORTER VINES ON TOP....\"BUT HAPPY TO SAY SINCE I DID THAT THE PLANT IS COMING OUT OF IT STALE MATE...IT IS GETTING GREENER AND THE HEART SHAPED LEAVES ARE GETTING LARGER...<br />\"SOOO, ALL IN ALL I\\'M GLAD I BOUGHT IT ; HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR THIS PLANT WHICH IS HARD TO FIND IN MOST PLACES AND HAD TO FIND IT ON LINE.....IT IS A HARDY PLANT AND AM TOLD IT WILL SURVIVE MOST ANYTHING EXCEPT FREEZING....<br />SOOOO, I\\'M HAPPY IT WAS PACKED GOOD AND NO DAMAGE ,THEY MADE SURE IT WOULD MAKE THE TRIP...<br />I\\'M HAPPY IT WILL GROW OUT AND LOOK LIKE I WANT IT TOO....<br />I\\'M HOPING THAT IT LIKES BEING ROOT BOUND SOO I DONT HAVE TO TRY AND REPOT IT ..DONT WANT TO KILL IT.... Received this today I guess when they say net weight they mean bag too? Only received 48 pounds of spelt not 50lbs. I triple checked the packages that I made with a very accurate, highly sensitive scale, had my spouse check the weights, and yep only 48 pounds of product. I am addicted to this wonderful drink. Most protein powders are chalky, or clumpy...but not CLICK...it blends well and tastes soooooo amazing. It is nice to have my caffeine fix that has some benefit to it. The only con??? I would love to purchase it in a larger quantity, and if it would go on sale more often!!!! I have a very finicky Shih Tzu that normally turns his head to most treats, but not this one!  When he sees me open the bag he does circles waiting for this!  Have already ordered more bags!  Don\\'t want to be without!  Highly recommend! Better than rice cakes. Low calorie count adds substance to meals or snacks.in addition has great taste.unfortunately,cannot be a substitute for rye bread with corned beef The most delightful tea, excellent for afternoon time alone and perfect for gift giving. Arrived on time and not even one tea leaf damaged! I just could not believe how absolutely delicious this pasta is. It was perfect in texture and it just tastes fantastic. I don\\'t know why the reviewer\\'s pasta turned out gummy, but mine had no problems. I don\\'t look at it as a substitute for regular pasta. I actually like this BETTER, there are no down sides to it at all. It doesn\\'t stick together like regular pasta either, or to the bottom of the pan. Einkorn flour dissolves quickly unlike dwarf wheat (regular) flour and the products made from it are less sticky too.<br />Try it, I promise you will like it! This is my dog\\'s favorite toy.  The rings are edible and not the least bit \"bad\" for him.  The Busy Buddy was actually recommended to us by his trainer since he\\'s a \"strong chewer\", and she was right!  It\\'s durable and keeps him occupied for at least 30-45 minutes when he has his fresh rings.  We\\'ll be continuing to buy these as long as he can chew.  :) MCP is the best -----HOWEVER---- if you can\\'t buy it anywhere, what good is it.  Almost impossible to find, what gives Kraft?  You would think that a premium product like this would be available for sale everywhere.  Very disappointing.  Kraft tells me that it is still being produced but could not tell me where to find it other than to check the local store that recently ordered it.  If the store has as much luck as everyone else has, they won\\'t find it either. We fell in love with this brand when we were visiting the west coast several years ago, it is wonderful. We have bought a couple tins every Christmas for the past few years for holiday parties. Buy the large tin, you won\\'t regret it! After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.  I\\'ve tried several flavors, and they like them all.  They are excited again at meal time.  The best benefit is that the \"tummy problems\" are so much better. Great addition to foods if you like things spicey! I put it on pizza, cream cheese as a cracker dip and also in salsa to jazz it up. A spoonful in a Bloody Mary is great too. While the boxes are lovely, the content isn\\'t. Everything in them save for the hard candy was stale, melted together into one fist sized ball, or both. You can find all the items inside at your local grocery store for about fifteen dollars. Maybe even your local .99 cent store. I am not sure the boxes and ribbon are worth the additional thirty five dollars, even if the items inside the boxes were fresh. I was very dissapointed with these chips.  I love Guitless Gourmet and I love black beans.  However, these chips tasted like olives.  GROSS!! [asin]<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBH9YO\">Senseo Douwe Egberts Medium Roast Coffee Pods, 18-Count 4.41-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> I like saving money on this deliciously rich, full bodied coffee for my Grindmaster coffee machine. It\\'s great to be able to make just one cup at a time, or more, with the pods, and the taste in consistently yummy! I\\'ve told my friends and they love the taste too! If you want a rich, smooth tasting, strong, but not bitter cup of coffee, I highly recommend this product.  It is not as dark as I normally buy, but it stands up quite well using my espresso machine (an inexpensive non-pump).  I was surprised at the crema it produced.  In short, it\\'s everything I look for in a delicious cup of coffee. These are low-fat, low-cal. I have never seen a dog who didn\\'t love them. I believe they are made by the same folks who make Wellness -- which is excellent dog food. Great drink for a hot summer day or a cool winter night.  Works for all seasons and you can be so creative with the juices.  It\\'s fun. I loved these crackers. They are not too sweet with perfect crunch. My niece and nephew (6 years old and almost three years old) loved them too. Yum! I purchased this item even though some of it\\'s reviews were negative. The first meal I made with these wraps were Enchiladas. It tasted great and was very filling!I am happy that I found a healthy alternative! Thank you, Dr Oz, for recommending the Lingonberry as a super antioxidant, as well as a diet aide!  I completely get it --  when you eat the lingonberry, your taste buds are immediately blasted into nonexistence by these mini-Sour Bombs, thereby making every other food tasteless and less enjoyable!  Voila... Diet!<br /><br />To describe the flavor, I can only say that when I tossed about 10 of these little babies into my mouth and chewed, I was almost launched through the roof and my face instantly went numb.<br /><br />My daughter, however, thought they were pretty delicious and ate them up.  I was glad that she liked them; they are pretty expensive.  I recommend these to anyone who really likes sour flavors. I LOVE this juice!  I think it\\'s delicious, with a fruity flavor that is great either on its own, or blended with more fruit/ice for a thicker consistency (this product is a bit thin).  Green Machine is naturally sweet, 100% juice, and my family and I love the way it tastes.  It may not be the prettiest smoothie on the block, but don\\'t let that deter you from trying it, because its looks don\\'t affect its flavor!<br /><br />I do agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this price is pretty high compared to where I shop, so making price comparisons may find a less expensive option for you.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product! The batter is easy to prepare, blends smooth, not lumpy. With the malt, the waffles are light & have good flavor. A real treat! We have a 4 oz stand up electric popcorn popper and find 4 oz bags a little hard to come by. This popcorn, salt and oil is 6 ozs and work perfectly in out 4 oz popper. About 80 to 90% of the grains pop and that is our only complaint. We have tested the kettle at very hot and at start up tempatures and there is still at least 10% of the grains unpopped. What are we doing wrong? my furry kids just LOVE these,cant keep for long,both prefer these Temptations to anything else. Yummy for the tummy,is a must buy I bought this mainly just for the planter itself. I had planned on using the seeds that came with it and then just using my own wheat grass seeds after since it costs much less. I was so happy with the plastic insert that comes with the seeds though that I\\'ve taken to keeping and reusing that each time as well. I just put my own seeds and potting soil/peat moss (whatever I have on hand) in it and am able to drain any extra water out very easily to avoid mold growing. I have been using two of these for my three cats for two years now and couldn\\'t be happier. I was afraid of bold because I think of bitter starbucks coffee but this was great.  It is strong and bursting with flavor in a good way, not bitter at all.  I got a sample with my coffee make and went out and bought a box. Another great tea from Celestial Seasonings. This one has a subtle spicy lemony flavor. Very unique. I have tried many varieties of tea, gourmet, loose leaf, etc. and I keep going back to Celestial Seasonings. All natural, easy to find and very reasonably priced. I prefer water with an alkaline content more in tune with my body\\'s. However, I don\\'t want \\'ingredients\\' in my water. I\\'d rather get my minerals & electrolytes from their natural source. So, if you want pure, clean, alkaline water, this is not for you. You might try Fuji water<br /><br />If you seek additives (electrolytes & minerals) in your water, then Essentia is a tasty option, if a bit pricey.<br /><br />Here is a list of ph levels of numerous bottled waters.<br />[...] First time buyer from this supplier.  Product was delivered on time and in great shape.  I love to cook vegetables with sesame oil and garlic but could only find small, expensive bottles at the grocer.  I now have plenty of oil and extra money in my wallet.  The can has a built-in spout for easy pouring with a handy snap on-off cap.  I also fill a squeeze bottle to set on the table for use as a spice. I ordered this product late Wednesday night, it was shipped the following day and I received it today, Tuesday.  I would have received it Saturday though, if I had had it shipped to my home address.  It looks exactly as pictured, smells amazing and I got the extra 1/8th a lb as a free gift (which equals to about 20 extra beans).  I\\'m making vanilla extract, so I won\\'t know for a couple months how good the beans are, but for right now, I am very happy with this company and their product! I picked up these honey sticks because I\\'m in a chai tea phase and thought they\\'d be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn\\'t much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I\\'d much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don\\'t expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up! I am completely hooked on Lipton\\'s glass size cold brew tea bags. The small tea bags can stay in your glass of tea all day and never leak leaves like the big tea bags.  Thank you Lipton! As far as I\\'m concerned, this is the best coffee. Dark and smooth. Strong flavor, no bitterness. By far my favorite.<br /><br />I brew it in a Aeropress -- (if you don\\'t know what one is, you\\'re missing out. All the fun of a French Press but much easier to clean.) It, and the Ebony Pearls are a match made in Coffee Heaven. My golden retriever enjoys this food-- in fact, she scarfs it down.<br /><br />I agree that this is a unique food in that it is low calorie yet also highly digestible. I appreciate that this food pays attention to skin and coat health (some of the very noticeable areas negatively impacted by most diet foods), and that it is very digestible, even though it includes lots of fiber to help your dog feel full.  Another great option is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000261NR6\">Nutro Ultra Weight Management Dry Dog Food (35-lb bag)</a>.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Ingredients include:<br />Rice Flour, Lamb Meal, Ground Rice, Rice Bran, Dried Plain Beet Pulp, Powdered Fiber, Natural Flavors, Soybean Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Poultry Fat (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Yeast Culture, Calcium Carbonate, Sunflower Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Potassium Chloride, Monocalcium Phosphate, Taurine, Dried Kelp Meal, Choline Chloride, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ascorbic Acid (source of Vitamin C), Manganous Oxide, Biotin, Garlic Flavor, Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Vitamin A Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (source of Vitamin B6), Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Chondroitin Sulfate, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid. I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn\\'t have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you\\'ll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though. This product has done amazing wonders for my wife\\'s GI system.  I would highly recommend it far and above over the counter products, which we have tried, without success for years. This is NOT hot chocolate in the classic sense. This is a hot, chocolate beverage not to be wasted on young children or adults lacking taste buds. You have to be someone that really ENJOYS flavors, textures, etc. to get the difference or you might as well stir up some swiss miss. I am in a 20 week medically supervised weight loss program to drop 60 pounds and this product is really helping me stay on track, 2 weeks in and 15 pounds down!  I will be traveling quite a bit for work in the next quarter and I was worried about staying on this program while I\\'m out of town.  I have had one of these dressing packets with my dinner salad every night since they arrived.  The dressing is tangy and the raspberry is sweet.  For only 40 calories per packet there is a TON of flavor!  I am only having greens in my salads, no cheese, no croutons, no seeds, no protein.  This dressing has made me look forward to my naked salads.  I am planning on buying a bottle for home so I don\\'t keep using these travelers up.  If you typically like Vinaigrette dressings and Raspberry specifically you will like these packets. I thought this would be worth trying due to the price, but my cats really disliked it...no diving into the bowl with this food! My older cat will happily eat almost anything, but one or two nibbles of this and she would walk away. This tastes great.  I love peanut butter, but not all the fat.  I mix this with my protein shake and it tastes great. Delicious bar! I love it.  It\\'s sweet, but not too sweet.  I love the crunchy pomegranates in it.  I reach for these bars ever morning for breakfast or a quick snack.  One thing I love about KIND bars is even if they have crisp rice, it\\'s not the majority of the bar like some other bars out there.  The bar is mostly nuts and fruits as advertised.  Overall, just a great and healthy snack to keep on hand. I\\'ve been buying coconut oil for a long time.  I\\'ve always been satisfied with what I got, after all, what can coconut oil be?  Then I tried this one.  It has a light, delicate flavor and a wonderful texture.  I use it in my hair, to shave, on my skin, to fry eggs, to mix with other ingredients.  It adds a nice touch to chocolate cake and goes well with most flavors of cheesecake.  I like this well enough to have a subscription.  First class stuff. For the longest time I\\'ve been looking for something that compares to Illy espresso (medium roast) at a lower price. Thought this was a deal as I\\'ve been paying $14+ per can of Illy. I read all the hype & tried to order via Amazon only to be told they will NOT ship this product to Hawaii.I found the Crema e Gusto somewhere else for less than $9/pack; sadly, I was disappointed with the slightly bitter undertone and will most likely go back to Illy. Any Illy addicts out there who found something as good at a lower price? I\\'ve tried to eat the 100% all natural peanut butter, many diff brands, found only 1 I liked, but then came across this one. Although its not 100% all natural, like most products like that only contain peanuts and maybe salt, this one too me still has few ingredients and no hydrogenated oils.  I don\\'t know how people like the \"just peanut\" peanut butter, but to each is their own.  I\\'m huge into organics and all-natural, but just can\\'t like the just peanut taste in peanut butter. I\\'ve gone through many jars within the passed 6 months.  The only 100% all natural peanut butter I liked was called Richards, not sure if Amazon sells it, but try that if you like just peanuts as your ingredients. Good luck! This is NOT one of their great flavored coffies..kind of bland..I augment the coffie with calorie free and sugar free hazelnut flavoring whic gives it a quite palateable taste.Really great price !! I spoke to a woman at India Tree at length about their ingredients. She said that for a short run of the product, they used a formulation that included propylene glycol and polysorbate to help preserve them and keep them from separating. They have since changed their formula BACK to the original with just vegetable color, water and citric acid. What you see on the ingredients label is CORRECT.<br /><br />That said, these colors are not nearly as vibrant as I hoped they would be, but given they are not chemical colors I can\\'t complain too much. My food allergic daughter gets to enjoy fun colors now, so I am happy. What a joy when I read about that!  The only problem is finding a way to add chocolate to my diet without all the extraneous sugars that are NOT so healthy.  In the past I have tried various higher percentage chocolates and found the Scharffen Berger bars to be excellent, so when I decided to get some cocoa powder this is one of the three I decided to try.<br /><br />For my purposes I have been mixing it in with a small amount of dairy to add to coffee.  Turns out this makes an excellent chocolate coffee.  I do the mixing at the bottom of the cup and spend some needed time making sure it\\'s blended, and then add the coffee after that.  Very good and I get to call it healthy.<br /><br />Using the unsweetened powder allows to add only the barest sweetner of choice--suit to taste so to speak.<br /><br />The other thing I\\'ve used it for is to mix up a bit of cream, the chocolate and a tiny bit of Splenda...blend it up in a bowl with a spoon until it thickens a bit and then it\\'s a great strawberry dip.  Again, I pretend this is health food--and really as desserts go, it\\'s not so bad if you are more interested in the science behind carbs vs fats (but that is a whole different topic).<br /><br />In any case, of the unsweetened chocolate poweders I\\'ve tried so far...this one is the best product in terms of taste when making my coffee--it\\'s good enough to keep me away from the coffee shop where the drinks are pricey and full of sugar.<br /><br />Recommended!!<br /><br />JTG<br /><br />eta: this is not \\'dutch processed\\' so the healthy benefits remain intact. The beans were very dry or over roasted.  The flavor was ok but not a great cup in the morning. The 5lb. bag will last me about 6 weeks as I do drink coffee thru-out the day 7 days a week.  Probably won\\'t try this type again.  Over-all I would give it a 4 on a 10 scale. I bought this tea for the first time in January, when the previous cinnamon tea I\\'d purchased became unavailable.<br /><br />I\\'m glad that I did! The aroma of this steeping tea is marvelous and the flavor lingers delightfully. It\\'s a strong tea, as well, waking me up effectively. Comes in very nice nylon bags, and you can definitely see (as well as taste) the superior quality of the tea leaf.<br /><br />I\\'ll be getting more of this tea, and likely not going back to multiple-source teas, but staying with single-source, now that I knew the difference. I will have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers here.  As someone who cannot have gluten or casein, I often have difficulty finding good cereals.  Unfortunately, Arrowhead Mills\\' Organic Maple Buckwheat Flakes continued that trend for me.<br /><br />Some of my complaints about this cereal are common to many -- it gets soggy quickly, it\\'s very expensive for its size, its nutritional value could be better.  What really bothers me, however, is the almost metallic aftertaste it leaves.  Although the ingredients say that it is made with natural maple flavoring, my refined New England maple tastes do not find this flavor to be anything familiar.  It is very strong and very unpleasant.  I found that I have had to brush my teeth immediately after eating each bowl just to get the aftertaste out of my mouth.<br /><br />I usually like Arrowhead Mills products, but this one misses the mark for me.  I\\'ll finish the box, but I won\\'t be buying it again. First let me say my personal taste is for light roast coffee. Starbucks and other dark roast coffee just taste burn to me.<br />I always buy a new instant when I see it hoping to find one that is palatable. I will drink Taster\\'s Choice if there is nothing else to drink. Like all instant it has a funny solvent or chemical taste to me.<br />Tchibo has actual hints of a nutty complex coffee taste and NO chemical taste. I did a blind taste test for my wife which is a game we often enjoy playing and she liked the Tchibo better too.<br />Properly brewed fresh roast Kona is still better. But this is good for camping and the emergency pantry. Not just tolerable. I\\'ve also found that a small amount of water soluble fiber (the sort that mix to a clear liquid) added to the instant improves the flavor. I suspect some of the undesirable flavors bind to it in the hot cup. We switched to Newman\\'s Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman\\'s Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes. He looked like he was on his last leg, the cat not my brother-in-law. Anyway, we started supplementing his food with Newman\\'s Own and I swear the cat looks 2 years younger. He is more active, his eyes have cleared up, and he has lost weight. The vet is amazed as well, as his sugar levels are better. I am not suggesting anyone use this food as a replacement for what a Vet has suggested. But if you have an animal who is not responding well, it is worth a try to add this product to their diet. Our dog loves this game even with just 1 treat (or piece of food) per section - and will \"play\" over and over again.  We just have to watch she doesn\\'t try to eat the yellow cups but the blue part is durable.  She easily figured out, tho, that she can move it around instead of spinning the disc to get the treats out.  She knows where we store this game and tries to get into the cabinet to get it out!  Great price at Amazon and a good value dog toy.  I would buy this again. This is absolutely THE BEST hot chocolate I\\'ve ever had!  It is so rich and chocolate-y.  We love it.  It is also delicious in a cup of coffee to make mocha.  You\\'re going to love this and after you\\'ve had it, you\\'ll never want any other kind of hot chocolate mix.  Enjoy..... UPDATE 5/1/2011: I guess I won\\'t be buying these anymore either they went up $20.00 (YES!!! TWENTY DOLLARS) in less than 1 year. The 3 pack of 34 ounce boxes were only $29.32 on June 9, 2011 when I last purchased them, now for the same boxes they raised the price to $49.99! I won\\'t deal with GREEDY Companies. I am also changing my 5 star rating to 1 star, the potaotes are good but not no where near $50.00 good. On a good note at least they didn\\'t shrink the packages too.<br />We\\'ve used these Hash Browns since the late 70\\'s/80\\'s. They use to be available at Costco, but Costco always discontinues everything that is good. It\\'s good to see that Amazon has them available and with no shipping charges.<br />These are dried shredded hash brown that will store a long time in your pantry, which saves on freezer space and time. You can use these hash browns for everyday use, cooking for large groups or fundraisers, emergencies, and camping.<br />They are very simple to prepare just cover the amount of hash browns that you want with hot water and let sit for about 10 minutes and fry until golden brown. They crisp up real nice, just like you get in a restaurant. You can also use them in casseroles or whatever else you\\'d use frozen hash browns for. I got this about two weeks ago & they are still going at it. It\\'s better than the other mammoth bone I originally got for my 63lb dog. This bone was for my little girl but my bigger dog hogs it all the time. The smell is intoxicating & my guess why the dogs love it. When it does get broken down my dogs love chewing at it & eating it. They even eat all the little crumbs that it makes. They LOVED the skin (is my guess what that is) that was on the bone. They had a great time scraping that off first before they got to the real \"meats\" of the bone. I wish it had a filling bc they enjoy licking it quite a bit. I would def buy this again.<br /><br />Oh & let me add that it goes down okay. My dogs didn\\'t get the runs which they normally do. The first night they did throw up but just a tiny bit, nothing compared to when they eat outside stuff. The nights afterwards they had zero problems. I also just noticed that when pieces do break off they don\\'t automatically go for it. I guess maybe those pieces were not appealing to them? So your dogs may be able to differentiate the good and not so good pieces. This way you just throw it away in the case the little pieces your 35lb puppy can\\'t chew doesn\\'t get lodged in her throat. Why does this product have BHT?  BHT is NOT healthy! It is an ingredient in jet fuels, rubber, petroleum products, electrical transformer oil, and embalming fluid.  Shame on Kellog\\'s. Whenever I need something a little special for dinner, Mario Sliced Black Olives can come to the rescue.  I put them in/on soup, salads, dips, meat loaf, sandwiches, steaks and more.  Not too salty, full of flavor, just the right thing for a little pazazz. I like the small cans also.  they hold just enough to split for two or three servings. I purchased this food for my finicky chihuahua. I noticed that I was throwing away more of her Royal Canin Chihuahua food than she was eating, so I knew I needed to make a switch, and I wanted to try high-quality, grain-free foods.  At the recommendation of several friends, I decided to try Wellness Core and am so glad I did! The first day I mixed it with her previous food (Royal Canin Chihuahua) and she actually spit out the old food and only ate the Wellness Core!  She didn\\'t have any stomach issues with it.  The next day she again gobbled down the Wellness Core.  My only complaint is that the pieces are a little big for her (a little smaller than a dime). She can still manage, but I wish there was a small dog version.  When I decided to make the switch to Wellness Core, I calculated how much it would cost in comparison to the Royal Canin Chihuahua I had been buying.  I was actually paying $14 for 2.5 lbs of Royal Canin at Petsmart, but got 12 lbs of Wellness Core, a higher-quality food for $29.99 with free shipping on Amazon- quite a savings!  I would recommend that anyone looking to go grain-free, or even just wanting a higher quality food try Wellness Core! It\\'s pretty expensive considering how much chips is actually in the package. But, it tastes great (similar to durian chips I\\'ve had in Thailand) & healthy to boot. If you\\'ve never tried durian / heard notorious things about the fruit / hated how the actual fruit tasted, fear not! It doesn\\'t taste/smell remotely like the fruit: more like non-oily potato chips with a smooth buttery aftertaste. I\\'ve tried all of the Fiber One Bars and I have to say that I love Oats and Peanut Butter the best! They taste great, like dessert and when I\\'m hungry and need something to fill me up for a bit, these bars do the job. Not only are they great tasting and fill you up, but they\\'re super good for you, too. A delicious way to get your fiber.<br /><br />***And for those of you on Weight Watchers, Fiber One Bars are 2 Points each!!! Yay!*** On the plus side, the box would probably have less sugar. But on the minus side, you\\'re paying $3 for 6 ounces of BHT flavored cardboard. I think you can get that cheaper at the Safeway. Got strong truffle smell before opening Amazons box - the jar was not closed properly.<br />You Cannot Sell Spices In Non-hermetically sealed jars!!! I found this salt one day in an Italian deli in Half Moon Bay, CA.  I got really hooked on the coarse variety.  After I ran out I tried other coarse salts, but they were not the same!  These crystals are smaller...just the right size, and NOT TOO SALTY.  Its hard to describe, but it makes all foods better.  You get that little crunchy taste which adds so much to fresh tomatoes, pasta, any food which needs a little salt.  I only use this right before eating....not in cooking. (I use the regular iodized salt to get my iodine when cooking!)<br /> The whole idea is that you want that texture and flavor.  I send for this online , and pay shipping (!) because I like it so much!  Highly recommended. I tried to switch my pug puppy to this food from another holistic brand and found it too rich for her. She started throwing it back up in just an hour or so after eating a very small amount of it. I switched her to WELLNESS Just for Puppy Holistic Nutrition. She has done very well with this. They also guarantee it or your money back. Price is comparable with Halo. I love this Honeybush tea.  No caffeine, great health benefits like rooibos, but a better flavor (IMHO) that goes well with sandwiches, tea cookies, or just on its own.  And it\\'s organic.  Thank you, Numi! After searching to find the bean with MILK chocolate and paying extra to get it here before Christmas I open the box and find that they are in fact DARK chocolate.  Clearly states Milk chocolate in the description.  Now its too late to resolve the issue before Christmas.  No phone numbers to call so that customer service can overnight what I ordered. I absolutely love these gummy worms (and the gummy bears). The texture is super yummy, and they are not overly sweet (since they are made with natural sweeteners) which doesn\\'t give me a stomach ache like conventional ones. These fulfill my craving for chewy candy without the guilt, and they are fair trade and organic- which both support good causes. I can\\'t see where you can go wrong with these! Also, the slightly higher price is worth it since (like i previously mentioned) they are healthy, yummy, and for a good cause!! The product itself is great. My only complain is that a few of the cans were dented. I wanted to like this, Im a fan of the whole natural Ital way of eating/living, but this drink sucks allot. I am NOT a huge coffee drinker nor am I particular about my coffee. Some discribe this as pretty mild with not much of a bitter after taste...to my family it is wartered down coffee flavored old boring plain tea. It is coffee flavored water! All of that said if you like SUPER mild coffee flavored water give it a try, but its a no go here.<br />bummer... Very good quality. Was not aware of it\\'s potent pureness, apple butter turned out quite cinnamonity to taste.  Had to add another bushel of apples to cut the taste. These are very tasty cookies. They are definitely extreme chocolate and remind me a bit of brownie bites. With Subscribe & Save they are very affordable. Of course they are less affordable when you gobble them all in one or two sittings. Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous.  This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy and tasty, and blend into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart. Red Zinger is especially good for colds--the ingredients strengthen the immune system and the tea is soothing to the throat. It is also great for a diet tea--the bold flavor helps with cravings and the diuretic ingredients prevent and ameliorate water retention. And aside from its benefits it is just a delicious tea! The flavor is sour-cherry with a hint of mint and flavorful hot or cold.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don\\'t package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />\"Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues.\"  Baltasar Gracian. I usually love Orgain Vanilla and have been consuming cartons of it for the last few months (through Amazon). While it is expensive, the convenience of opening a tetrapack at night outweighs the cost. The ingredients are great<br />Just recently I had an awful experience. The latest cartons I ordered had a petroleum taste to the product. I opened 6 atleast to find one that did not taste bad but to no avail. Luckily Amazon refunded me.<br /><br />I spoke with Orgain and it seems that this was a batch specific issue. Tea box arrived in perfect condition. Logos placed correctly inside and out. I LOVE the look and size of this box. No problem with the hinges either. Sorry to say no mistake was made with adding tea bags that were not supposed to be there....just received the empty box...<br />..great deal all by itself! Love the taste not to hot but a little tangy.  Price is good and really good service. I rate the Gia Russa *****. It is great as a marinate, I drizzled it over tomatoes and monzarella cheese, also, bake aspagarus rolled in fillo and baked with the glaze drizzled over, was delicious. It is so good you can eat it on ice cream. I order<br />nine bottles to give as gifts.[[ASIN:B00282B2IW Gia Russa Balsamic Glaze, 8.5-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 3) I bought this for my brother. He has one of those machines. I don\\'t. But I was out of coffee so I took 6 of the K-Cups and opened them and used them to brew a pot of coffee. I\\'m not a flavored coffee fan either -- but I really liked the coffee. Full-bodied and mildly flavored. The feedback from my brother\\'s household affirms my opinion. Messy but it does taste like jerky! Definitely worth trying if you need some vegan convenience foods. The texture and the taste were almost too meat-like. One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost \"muddy\" odor. By \"muddy,\" I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you\\'re looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend. Purchased these lollipops (Big Bird, Elmo & Cookie Monster) for my son\\'s 2nd birthday party. They are adorable!! Not only do they look great but they\\'re delicious as well. I would HIGHLY recommend buying these--would be great as favors or just as a little treat to have out. I must admit that I love lychee tea.  It has been hard to come by in recent years.  This tea is very good and at a very reasonable price. Organic and low sodium plus lots of flavor.  Put a few Fritos in a bowl, cover with chili, sprinkle on some chopped onions and a little cheddar cheese.  Fabulous!  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product as I can\\'t find it in any of our supermarkets. Well, the other reviewer are correct; this is a very fine cat food. Yes, it looks and smells tasty--flakey chunks in gravy. Probably tastes as good as human food (and just as expensive, but I presume it is formulated for cats). I like the way it is packaged and the small servings are just right. I actually divide it in half for my two cats, because I free-feed them kibble. They snarf it down! They don\\'t fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It\\'s what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we\\'re talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you\\'ve just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g\\'s of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I\\'ve seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don\\'t know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don\\'t lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It\\'s my fault, I suppose for not researching. I can\\'t understand why some people don\\'t like these.  I can only think that they either didn\\'t check the expiration date or they didn\\'t carefully read the instructions.  I rinsed them in cold water, then in hot water and set them on a paper towel to dry.  Then, they tasted like what ever sauce I put on them.  You really can\\'t ask for more in something that is zero calories.  I am so happy to have and eat these noodles!  They help me look forward to a meal.  I would recommend them to anyone who is on a special diet like me. The manufacturer of this Dark French Roast Coffee advertises that it is gourmet coffee with less than half of the acid found in regular coffee. This minimizes, they say, heartburn, acid reflux, and mild stomach irritation. They add that their coffee lacks \"the bitterness\" found in regular coffee. My wife and I tried the coffee and found no difference in taste between it and the regular store brand coffees. We have tried several decaf coffees but found this particular one to be our favorite.  It has good flavor and you do not get that \"decaf\" aftertaste as with many others. I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They\\'re crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you\\'re going to want more! After trying these you\\'ll find it hard to believe they\\'re pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it\\'s worth checking it out). I\\'ll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they\\'re absolutely delicious, they\\'re also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That\\'s fine with me but it\\'s just a a little off putting. But this one hits the mark. One of the hardest things to replicate in gluten free items is texture. I do not like soft cookies so I am delighted with this product. When non-celiac friends are over, I make sure I have a couple bags because if they get into them, they disappear pronto. Nice ginger \"bite\" to the flavor profile too. I have yet to not be thrilled by any of the Pamela\\'s products that I have purchased! Buy these cookies by the case from Amazon; this will save you money, insure freshness, and they are delivered right to your door if your total order is over $25. Is corn the main ingredient or Quinoa? I see this to be good for the folks who need \"gluten\" free, but I want to eat it for the health benefits. Which one is the main ingredient? Isn\\'t it a label violation if corn is the main ingredient (they list corn flour as the first ingredient)? I need to know! Until the manufacturer publishes that, I am not getting this product anymore! I am afraid to order any more of this brand! I ordered a 2 pound bag of CACAO NIBS and what I THOUGHT was a 2 pound bag of CACAO BEANS, but I was not paying attention when I ordered this product.  THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY 2 POUND BAG OF CACAO BEANS, but instead, to my surprise, got two 2-pound bags of CACAO NIBS!!!!  I suppose it\\'s my fault for NOT READING THE CAPTION BELOW THE PIC, but I was in a hurry that day.<br /><br />The nibs are a great product, but I do NOT NEED 4 pounds of it!  I WISH I HAD GOTTEN WHAT WAS BEING ADVERTISED IN THE PICTURE, INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS BEING ADVERTISING VERBALLY.  LOL Good subtle flavored coffee for the mid-afternoon pick me up. A bit of sweetness without being overdone. Wish it was available in whole bean as I like it stronger then the Keurig cup can make it. No bitterness here...this is a hearty but mellow choice in the Tully\\'s lineup.  We especially like the 50 pack convenience.  Jet Fuel is also great.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HPGVPK\">Delightful Short Stories Little Romances</a> I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It\\'s a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can\\'t eat just one! If you like salt and vinegar chips and are looking for a healthier alternative, you have got to try these! They are absolutely addicting. My husband enjoys this soup; we mainly eat soups with no meat products.  It\\'s pretty thick and not a lot of calories. Really nice, you know how some chocolates irritate your throat , this one does not. Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!<br /><br />This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.  But for my taste, I couldn\\'t choke down even a few bites of this stuff.  Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product. This is my favorite of the Mrs Bryant\\'s apple sauces -  it has a wonderful tartness that adds something special to the  pure apple taste -  I have  had it cold, warm and on toast and served it with pork  - and it is always a hit with everyone. I highly recommend this  - although all the Mrs. Bryant\\'s Apple Sauces are really delicious and special - this is just my personal favorite. I just finished my second box of the dark choco cherry cashew. Im over in a hot box so I knew they would arrive somewhat melted, so I threw them in the freezer and they were amazing! If you have kids I dont recommend freezing them but if not you should try esp if they arrive melted they harden up (no mess at all). I use this product mixed with chocolate or vanilla Soy Slender, which also has 30% calcium, 25% D, and 7 g fiber.  Of course I love it as it is, but this combo is my favorite.<br /><br />And I will be happy to answer M \"M\" about why.  This is four (4) canisters so it\\'s not that expensive.  The other reason, besides it is good, is that those grocery stores you speak of don\\'t have it. It has become very hard to find.  I can\\'t find it at all any longer and am very happy to order a supply at Amazon. I am new to using this product, but so many recipes call for the sheets rather than the powder that I finally bought some. I researched and found that the \"gold\" is supposed to be the best, my daughter uses it and loves it. If you like almonds, and you like cocoa, then try these!  If you don\\'t like almonds run to another aisle in the store and get something you do like.  The smoked almonds are pretty good, too.  They taste like they\\'ve been barbecued. I have been using this product for many years and I love it. Every so often I try another brand, but I always come back to Swheat. The odor control (my main issue with 4 cats) is outstanding, and the clumping is just fine. A friend of mine has multiple cats in a small apartment had a terrible odor problem, but would not take any of my advice. She was recently hospitalized and so I have been caring for her cats. I switched the litter to Swheat, and guess what. Odor problem solved overnight.<br /><br />I have no idea what these bad reviews are all about. I would imagine if bugs are an issue in your area, they might be attracted to Swheat. I live in a large city and do not have a bug issue, and have never seen bugs in or around the bag. I have never experienced any gooey mushiness, but I am guessing that if you do not use the litter properly this might happen. Here\\'s the thing, and this pretty much goes for any litter. You must fill the litter pan with several inches of litter (3-4 in) in order to gain maximum benefit. Otherwise, how is it supposed to clump properly, or control odor? Covering the bottom of the pan with 1/2 inch is not proper use of any litter.<br /><br />I cannot imagine anyone, with proper use of this litter, not loving it. Best litter ever, that\\'s all there is to it. I love my Keurig, and I have searched far and wide for a great tasting decaf.  Until I tried Emeril\\'s Jazzed Up Decaf, I didn\\'t think one existed.  This is without a doubt the most delicious coffee I\\'ve ever tasted, decaf or regular!!!! This frozen item arrived at least a week later than expected and at room temperature.<br />For a meat product (sausage) not good.<br />Just how long was it at room temperature???????????????<br /><br />Only saving grace...at least the dog didn\\'t get sick My dogs have NO ambivalence toward their dinners when I mix this in. They absolutely love it. I am very pleased with this product. Lamb is very good for dogs, too. I love that this food is very healthy and has no grains. Awesome product. I will definitely buy again. A+++++ ...I bought these because Amazon was running a \"buy $59, get $25 off sale\" -- which made these Jack Link products cheaper than the geletan-bound pre-fab dog treats available at the pet store.  About 1/2 the price per ounce, actually.<br /><br />And of course the pups think they\\'ve been run over by the \"Good Dog Truck.\"  Before you write angry rebuttals telling me how these are not good for dogs, let me assure you they really are \"treats\" for especially good (and sometimes rare) behavior-- and I snip each stick into button-sized rounds with my kitchen shears so they go a long way.<br /><br />It\\'s the smell that gets them.  Actual meat that was once on an animal.  Mmmmmm-mmm-mmmm.<br /><br />And for me -- like walking by a bakery.  The smell is more than enough, thanks. Don\\'t waste your money on this product.  I just ordered 12 boxes of Casbah Tabouli and I will not make it according to their directions again!  Number 1, all of the spices are mixed with the bulgar wheat....don\\'t like that.  Number 2, follow the directions on the box and they will have you put 1/3 of a cup of olive oil in the mix....way too much olive oil.  Next time I will try only a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  Best bet is to buy Near East Taboule....much better! These tasty cherries and cherry juice make such a difference in your cocktail!  Use instead of regular big maraschino cherries.....They are the best !! I have a Waring Pro, and this stuff is fantastic. It is salty and buttery, and tastes like movie theater popcorn. Some complain it doesn\\'t all pop, that\\'s because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop. It always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up. I love it. Best Energy bar ever...healthy, tasty, & less than 4 ingredients.  What could be better than that.  Great taste too. We have 3 cats, but our smallest is the pickiest.  Out of dozens of canned food, which we feed occasionally as a treat, this is the only can that Zoe will eat.  In fact, she comes running when the wife bangs her little bowl because she knows she\\'s getting the treat.  When I found Amazon.com had the food, I started buying it by the case.  I can\\'t find it in the store any longer.  I hope they keep making it. I really like the Keurig, single cup system (other than the portion size). The portions seem to be based on European preferances rather than American preferances.  The Gloria Jeans coffee is rich, with chocolate undertones, it is not overwhelmingly chocolate. However, the taste is great. It has just enough chocolate to satisfy my Grande Mocha chocolate coffee addiction. If it were more chocolaty I would have given 5 stars. I like this coffee. It\\'s a little different than the French roast I\\'m used to, but different in a good way. It\\'s got just a hint of a smokey flavor. Maybe I\\'m not saying that right, but that\\'s what it seems to me. It\\'s rich, like French roast, but different, like I said. It\\'s very good coffee. Although this is one of the best instant coffees in the world, I second another review here. Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months. So, unless you consume one of these at least 2-3 times per week - which I don\\'t per se - watch out. Also, I shaved off a star bc of the poor packaging design of the individual packets. When you tear off the corner (the way they indicate where and how to open it)  the opening is still very small and a fair amount of powder is still left in the packet unless you shake it vigorously and make sure it all comes out, or simply chop off the top with a scissor. I LOVE this coffee- it blows pretty much all the others<br />away, including Starbucks and Gevalia-- and it\\'s a great<br />price.<br />I was turned on to Melitta by my aunt in New York, but that<br />was the Traditional and it worked for me for several years-<br />then I saw the European Roast and that\\'s all I drink now.<br /><br />I get this coffee shipped to me monthly, cheaper<br />than I can grab it at Publix. I love Amazon!<br /><br />Try this coffee, don\\'t let the great price deter you-<br />it\\'s dark, rich and yummy! I\\'ve been looking for a decent replacement for Teavana\\'s Eastern Beauty Oolong that was discontinued last year.  This is perfect.  A great value for the price, not to mention the pretty tin and cute little jade teapot charm.  I would definitely buy this again. I\\'ve eaten this raisin bran for 40 years.  It\\'s better than all the rest.  My only disappointment is that it\\'s becoming increasing difficult to locate.  Which is why I have been ordering it here. This is by far our favorite coffee to use in the Senseo.  We discovered it in a variety pack we often ordered, and decided that we liked it so much that we needed to start ordering it by itself in bulk.<br /><br />It\\'s awesome that both my husband and I like it so much, because he leans toward bold coffees while I tend to go a little bit mild.  I think this one would qualify as being on the more bold side of the spectrum, but not extremely so.  It also has a slightly chocolaty flavor to it somehow...  Just barely. I\\'m not sure how much good a review of Szechuan peppercorns will do for anyone.  If you\\'re looking for it on Amazon, then you probably know what you\\'re getting.  I bought the 4-oz package, which was a huge amount of the product -- easily enough for a year in our house of once-per-week stir fry.  These were fairly priced, and had plenty of punch -- a little too much punch, in fact.  My favorite recipe for stir fried Szechuan chicken with ginger calls for a tablespoon of these.  The result was a meal that smelled wonderful, but all we could taste was the peppercorns.<br /><br />So if you\\'re looking for that \"spicy/numb\" mouth-feel, these are what you\\'re looking for.  You might want to dial the portions back a little, though. These chips are very tasty, but not \"flavored\".  I have nothing against BBQ, pesto, sour cream and onion, etc. flavored chips, but sometimes prefer the classic potato chip taste.  Yukon gold chips are thick and hearty, not too oily or salty... just right! I gave this product 4 stars because the taste and price are right.  If the effects were as noticeable as they are for 5-Hour Energy, I\\'d easily give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately I didn\\'t get what I thought I would out of this product.  Then again, I\\'m not as sensitive as a lot of people are about the effects of energy shots. Let me say it again, WOW! These little cubes go a long way and the flavor is excellent. Use them to spice up any dish. These are a must for any cupboard. I guess Rihanna must not have functioning taste buds.<br /><br />The 2 stars are better than one- for health and natural-ness.(?)<br /><br />I imagine this will be cleared out very soon! My sister got some of these for me and now I\\'m hooked , not to many stores carry them around my area and I buy them by the case :) I snack on them daily. They are tasty but almost half the crisps were broken or shattered when I got the box my guess is that just the normal shipping process via ups/prime is too much for their delicate nature.<br />It is tasty dust and fragments but if you want the whole box I would recommend finding in local store.<br /><br />Pros:  Tasty and nice texture on the unbroken ones<br />Cons: to fragile to ship. This tea is like a \"light\" breakfast tea. It is medium amber in the cup with nice malty overtones that are not  as powerful as many of the breakfast tea blends. It has a very smooth taste with no bitterness and does not linger unpleasantly on the palate after finishing the cup. The steeped leaves are nice and large with a golden hue. This is just a lovely stand alone tea that can be had at any time of the day and tastes great with or without sugar and milk. I got these for the hubby and son. Their birthdays are on the same day and I was planning on splitting them up between them since they both love licorice.<br />I had to test them of course. Very nice. A touch grainy in my opinion but still delish!!<br />They are also individually wrapped which is great since they are going in a candy dish for the hubby\\'s desk at work.<br />Very pleased with this product all around. This is very good tea, in a nice \"split\" teabag.<br />What more can I say?  Jasmine green tea, sweetened with a little stevia, is a wonderful drink. This is a \\'must have\\' for real coffee afficionados  ... and this particular company manages to avoid the hard-as-bricks packaging of rivals. This is a great jerkey substitute if you\\'re vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it\\'s very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Stonewall\\'s is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. If you don\\'t like your jerkey hot, I suggest you try mild or teriyaki. Otherwise, this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully! First time I tried this.  Ordered it for a friend who has trouble sleeping.  She said it helped.  I will start on it as soon as my current supply of magnesium citrate is depleted.  Gread product and service as always... My wife and I tried these and we love the smooth coffee flavor.  It\\'s hard to stop with only one. My husband takes a Kind bar with him to work everyday. He eats it for his afternoon snack. That way he\\'s not hungry until dinner. After you get use to the lack of sweet from all the sugar in soda it is hard to go back to regular soda.  Hopefully it is a healthy alternative. I purchased these because the picture on the package looked really good.  You would not believe how awful they are.  If you are set on buying them, you will soon find out. The amount of cake you mix up looks like a tablespoon of cake batter and these have trans fat in them.  They taste awful and do absolutely nothing to satisfy a chocolate lover.<br /><br />There is nothing in them.  Waste of money. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn\\'t allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I\\'ve tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren\\'t overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn\\'t stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don\\'t think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal. This is a classic candy bar. I love this candy and probably rate it among the best. There is only ONE problem, and that is if you bought it at the store it would be a little cheaper. I purchased a case of 25 bars and it came to a little over a dollar a bar. I can get it at most convenient store or even CVS for about 75 cents each. not a good internet bargain. Also let me add that if you put it next to another kind of bar like snickers or almond joy it seems very little for the money. Come on Planters get with the program! Murray \"Sugar Free Fudge Dipped Vanilla Wafer Cookies\" are a good tasting, diabetic friendly, snack food.<br /><br />While not quite a good as regular fudge dipped wafers, having a slightly odd after taste, these are quite acceptable.<br /><br />Recommended! I discovered Orlando Vanilla a few years ago while spending a week in Puerto Vallarta. I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I\\'ve tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you\\'ve had good vanilla you\\'ll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don\\'t think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested) This is a good tea that has a nice flavor. My only complaint is that for a rich tea, you have to use extra tea bags. This is sold in bulk which helps off set the price for using more tea bags. Great tea, better price than if you ordered from their website but I dislike having to order in quantities of 6 boxes at a time. If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These particular almonds pack a lot of flavor and kick.  They are great for a quick snack that is full of flavor.  They are delicious. Great price, excellent value.<br /><br />Shipping was very fast! Package arrived in perfect condition. Expiration date for these food items is nearly one year from date of arrival - again, an excellent value.<br /><br />Oh, and they taste great! Variety packs are a bonus, all three flavors are great. To the person who rated this low to due getting just 1 bag...read what you order. Very unfair to rate a product 1 star due to your own error.<br />The bags are great!! So far I\\'ve only tried the alder one which gives a lighter taste than the mesquite.<br />*Read the instructions WELL on the INside of the cardboard*<br />I bought a 4-pack of rainbow trout from [...] and rubbed kosher salt inside the fish a couple of hours before cooking. Preheated oven to 475F, placed 1 large cubed zucchini and the 4 fish inside the bag, folded closed and placed on a low rack. Lowered temp to 375F after 15 min and continued for another 25-30 min (3 lbs of fish) = perfection! My kids were crazy about eating \"fish tummy\" and this couldn\\'t have been any easier to cook or easier to clean up.<br />A very light smoke lingered around the kitchen, but nothing that I\\'d need to even open the windows for. If the smell is a problem, use your bbq (instructions include oven, coal or gas grill).<br />Too bad the price is such a rip off...these are available for under a buck in Finland. I bought this exact same box for our new kitty on June 10, 2011 for only 8.94. I came back to purchase it today and it has increased to 17.31! I ordered it anyway because it will arrive in two days whereas the offer of 3 - 14 pound boxes won\\'t arrive for an estimated 6 days, but I am not happy about paying DOUBLE for the same product a little over two months later.<br /><br />The same thing happened with the pack of 3 - 14 pound boxes. I bought those June 29, 2011 for 20.98 and they are now 34.50.<br /><br />I\\'m hoping these ARE price \"fluctuations\" and not permanent price increases.<br /><br />Just thought this would be important information for cost conscious kitty cat lovers! This dog food is absolutely amazing! My two dogs, 40lb. mix and 7lb. papillon, both LOVE it! They\\'ve been on this food for nearly 2 years. I get compliments ALL THE TIME on how soft they are, and how shiny their coats are, etc. You feed less, because it\\'s such a high quality food, and therefore have less waste. Who doesn\\'t want that?! I\\'ve worked at two different pet stores and I am very familiar with natural/organic/hollistic pet foods, and I\\'ve had the best results with this food! It is SO worth the price, because the benefits are SO worth it. For you and your dog! Try it, you won\\'t be sorry! Hickory is one of the top flavors when we asked US troops what they like.  They love the steak strips as they are a bit softer but very satisfying.  If being able to carry along a snack, and needing protein is part of your decision, this flavor in a steak strip cannot be beat !  You won\\'t go wrong on this item. I like this tea even better than my standard tea that I have been drinking for years, Good Earth Decaf Green Tea.  This version has a fruity taste that I love and is organic.  It also has strong flavor, so I can make up my big mug (16 oz) and even get a second mug out of one teabag.  It does not get bitter when brewed too long or as it sits after brewing.  A great option if you avoiding caffeine, since decaf green teas are hard to find.  Highly recommend. The illy cappucino has a nice unsweetened flavor.  Of course, the challenge is having the texture of a cappucino in a can, and that challenge has not been mastered.  The texture is a little thin and flat.  The instructions say not to shake the can, which I would have though to help.  Overall, it\\'s a fine substitute for convenience. I wish I could buy this rice blend in my local store.  RiceSelect Royal Blend rice is for those of us who like flavorful mixed grains, with the firmer consistency only possible with long cook rice.  The nutrition in this grain combo is phenomenal and the taste is fabulous.  I buy the 4 jar package and it comes out cheaper than if I could actually talk my grocer into carrying it.  The flavors complement a gumbo, spanish rice,  a bacon/ham and pecan casserole, or anything with a stronger flavor even oriental and indian dishes.  For milder dishes like Indian Butter Chicken, you might like your regular white, basmati, or jasmine rices, although I generally use these whole grains for almost everything.  Jars were package very well, packed for shipping very well, and shipped promptly.  Rice lovers will love this product. I am surprised by the negative reviews here.  I mean, instant cider (the kind you get in the packets) will never taste like real cider.  This is actually better than the brands of instant cider I have found.  Yes, it is sweet, and the caramel \"finish\" is a nice addition.  This is the only K-Cup product I have found that is sugar free, which I appreciate.  If you enjoy instant cider, I wouldn\\'t hesitate. I truly must say I love the Timothy\\'s brand of K cups, I have yet to try one I didn\\'t like.  I love the german chocolate, but I wanted to try a darker brew...and this one filled the bill.  I tried this on the size down from the travel mug setting on the B70 and it was truly rich, dark and satisfying; I can only imaging trying this on the lower settings.  If you love a darker, more intense tasting coffee, this is the brew to try. Wow!  I cannot believe that so much<br /><br />good healthy stuff could be in such<br /><br />a small package! The calorie count,<br /><br />etc. would help others choose this<br /><br />unique food bar. Newmans beef organic beef never fails.  My pooch (miniature poodle) never fails to gobble it up along with the premium kibbles I feed her.  She\\'ll eat other canned foods but the Newman\\'s is her first choice for dinner. I was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad, and had a really bad Sucralose flavor. I don\\'t know if I\\'m just not as picky as others or what it is, but I thought this hot cocoa was really good. Creamy and rich, and almost TOO sweet. I don\\'t think it has an \"aftertaste\" though, how some have described. I used the middle water setting on my Keurig or \"small mug\"...7.25 oz., I guess. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but as for me, I really like this product! I bought this spray because it doesn\\'t contain Deet and is in pump, not aerosol, form; however, its protection was meager.  I used it on a beach in Honduras to protect me from sand fleas.  My husband chose to use nothing.  I ended up with half the number of bites, but I still had many bites.  In even more insect-heavy areas of Central America, I had to resort to a Deet product because this Picardin-based repellent did little to discourage biting flies.  This is much better for mosquitos than for other biting insects.<br /><br />While I would use this spray in instances where the flying insects are bothersome but not relentless.  In areas where your health may depend on repelling insects, look elsewhere.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann My husband and I like to buy Newman\\'s products. We love their cookies so we thought our dogs might like them, too. So we got these dog treats and the LOVE them. They\\'re even shaped like hearts! They come with 6 bags so they\\'ll last a while but they\\'re packaged so they won\\'t go stale. As my husband and I get older, we are trying to make healthier choices with what we are eating.  We both love cereals with our breakfast, but let\\'s face it - many cereals out there are over-processed and loaded with sugar and other things.  We like oatmeal, but oatmeal can be a bit boring.  This Muesli from Bob\\'s Red Mill is fabulous!  It has a variety of whole grains in it, plus nuts, sunflower seeds, raisins and dates.  It cooks up easily with boiling water and makes a nice, thick, hearty hot cereal.  It\\'s wonderful \\'as is,\\' but even better with a sprinkle of brown sugar or a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.  We highly recommend Bob\\'s Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli. I\\'ll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I\\'ve always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I\\'m happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it\\'s hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I\\'m allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don\\'t protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once. I\\'ve had a lot of different kinds of cococnut water and this is by far the most palatable flavor for me. It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands. This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut. There\\'s also no aftertaste, it goes down clean. Excellent beverage for rehydrating, especially when you let it get real cold. This is better for you than drinking gatorade. I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising. Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth! I am a lap-band patient and was having a very hard time finding a protein shake that I actually could stomach, but this one is the winner.  I use fat-free milk, and some vanilla almond milk to mix mine up.  Its quick, tasty, and gives a nice jolt with the espresso already in the mix!  I have yet to try it hot, but for quick and easy cold mixing I highly recommend one of those blender bottles.  I also like their new flavor: vanilla latte. Tastes great, gluten free, high in protein and the answer to a search for cereal<br />that makes life easier for someone with diabetes and celiac! This is amazing stuff. For all you green tea lovers out there you must get your hands on this. I\\'m a huge fan of Buddha\\'s Herbs and they are the KINGS in the tea market. Thats for sure. I absolutely love this tea. it is so smooth and relaxing. You should even check out their Chamomile Tea which is also excellent. Dont think, JUST BUY!!!! Maybe I didn\\'t read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it\\'s very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can\\'t trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy... We bought this toy for our two granddogs as a Christmas present.<br />The larger, a boxer/pit bull mix was clever enough to grab onto the<br />yellow cups & just lift & easily found the treats. However, the<br />beagle was unable to grab onto the cups thus making him work harder<br />for the treats. Its quite entertaining to watch him go crazy trying<br />to figure it out. It keeps him occupied for about ten minutes. I bought this to use with my face mask called \"Aztec healing clay\" mi mix this with it instead of water and wow, it clears my face up and makes it feel so clean. i also drink two tablespoons mixed with a little water in the morning and at night. i ALSO use it sometimes in the shower on a wash cloth for my face to get all the junk out of my pores. my skin has never looked better!! I\\'ve purchased both the .097 oz 24 packs and the small 100 packs in both mild and regular.<br />The mild and regular taste very similar and blindfolded I probably couldn\\'t tell the difference. A great, if unhealthy snack that satisfies quickly. Cheap alternative to overpriced jerky. This coffee is just ok; personally I prefer Barrista Italian - it\\'s just more robust.  Barrista may cost more, but the flavor is far superior to Tully\\'s. I\\'ve used brining bags before so when I saw a good price on this 6 pack I thought I was doing myself a favor. I was dead wrong. Thanksgiving eve I went to turn my turkey over and the top opened up completely from the slightest movement. I had turkey brine spilling out into the fridge and all over the floor. Not something I needed to deal with when I was trying to get my pies baked and the table set.<br /><br />If I weren\\'t a pregnant working mom of a toddler I would return these, but I think I will pass them on to some frenemies instead. I bought Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E23VXW\">Living Harvest Organic Hemp Protein Powder, Original Flavor, 16-Ounce Plastic Container</a> to compare the two. The latter is slightly more expensive, but doesn\\'t seem to be worth the price.<br /><br />As others have said, the Nutiva powder mixes very easily and compared to Living Harvest\\'s, it\\'s far less grainy and bitter. I mix it with warmed soy milk and sugar and find it very delicious w/out added fruits or juices, despite other comments that say the taste isn\\'t all that great. I\\'ve noticed, though, that if I mix it and drink it hours later, or make a batch for the following day, it tastes slightly bitter, so it\\'s better when it\\'s made fresh.<br /><br />I finished my 16 oz. container in a week because I couldn\\'t stop drinking it. I\\'m working on the Living Harvest powder just for comparison, but I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ll be sticking with Nutiva. It\\'s cheaper, more finely ground, and less bitter. Once I\\'m done with Living Harvest, I\\'ll be buying the 3 lbs bag. I discovered these a few months ago & I just love them - they are so tasty - a good healthy snack that crunches. It has fiber, protein & tastes great! I love this coffee!  I love that they do not use plastic....good for the enivronment and, due to no BPA, good for my health!  The use of plastic cups was one of the reasons I did not like the Keurig.  Good job San Francisco Bay Coffee! This product is great tasting! I was eating the pepitas at half the price due to not finding USA made pumpkin seeds. The pepitas tasted bitter and were much larger.  I hope Red Mill continues to make their pumpkin seeds in the USA. It\\'s worth the higher price for excellent quality and supporting local USA companies. This stuff is so good, and with a little lemon squeeze, it\\'s over the top.<br />Want a fast delicious lunch or snack?<br />Try boiling up a handful of fine egg noodles, drain, return to pot and add a serving of this juice (dried parsley and seasoning optional) like soup...<br />heat up (don\\'t leave boiling). (1/2 tsp.\"Mrs.Dash\" (onion and herb) is a good seasoning for this)<br />While your noodles are cooking (only takes 4 minutes)...cut yourself a thick slice of Mozzerella and put it<br />in a soup bowl. Microwave for about 30 seconds to melt cheese.<br />When your juice and noodles are heated, pour in bowl over melted cheese. Mmmm. In five minutes you\\'re got a healthy, hot, economic meal.<br />Variation: Can use leftover rice instead of noodles, add fresh baby spinach, fresh cooked zucchini, etc.<br />Thumbs up to this awesome product. And it\\'s even packed in glass! I\\'m so disappointed in this company! I\\'ve been drinking this water for quite a while now, but yesterday I saw my nutritionist and she checked my pH level which was acidic.  I told her that was surprising considering how much alkaline water I drink.  She suggested we test the pH of my bottle of Essentia,  so we did.  The pH was ACIDIC at 6.6!!  I was livid!  Now to be fair..I am a nurse and know that the pH strips can expire and should be stored and handled a certain way and should also be tested by buffers.  I can\\'t guarantee my nutritionist followed these steps so I plan on purchasing my own pH strips and checking the water again.  I sure hope the strip was wrong and the next test will yield different results!  I will definitely post those results either way! Our 9 month old originally was spitting up a lot. We had him 1st on Similac regular, then went to Similac Sensitive and finally to Similac Soy.  The soy did the trick. He was on similiac soy for the past 6 months. When the Similac recall went through, my wife became disgusted with Similac and suggested we try a new brand. I was reluctant but did so anyway.  We reminded ourselves that as babies get older, they become less fussy, less gassy and maybe they don\\'t need SOY anymore if that\\'s what they were used to. So I went to my local Whole Foods store and bought the Lactose Free Baby\\'s only formula. AN instant hit !!!!! My son loves it ! Seriousely. He gobbles it down...all 6 oz in once shot. Before with the similac soy, he would have to take a break in between.  My wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy.  Well, if adults like it, I am sure babies would too !  I am very happy thus far with our choice. We were going to get Natures Best, but read that the way they extract their DHA is not ideal. Glad I realized that.  So far so good ! We always thought that our baby would be stuck with SOY formula...thank\\'s to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition, we realized that is NOT the case.  I am happy about that since SOY can cause some hormonal problems.....babies and adults alike.  Thank you Baby\\'s only for making an excellent product ! I drink my coffee as coffee, nothing added.  In my opinion, Caribou Blend is the very best K-cup coffee out there.  The blend is perfect and the taste is smooth, not too bitter.  Also, about the caffeine - You get your morning wake up with no jitters.  My number one K-cup. I\\'m not religious, but bless you Zico. Being able to buy in bulk is the only way to go. Will order again. I do prefer the tetra packs but the bottles were convenient. make oatmeal with water, add a package of frozen spinach, add skim milk near the end of the cooking process<br /><br />make oatmeal with ground beef, a spoonful of mushroom base, a dash of teff and slices of crushed ginger, add milk near the end of the cooking process<br /><br />This costs about $2.50 in a store. This tastes like I remember coffee tasting and has a wonderful aroma.  It comes in a box of 25 single serve pods that you just drop in your cup (the pods are marked with \"this side down\") and add hot water.  Let it steep for a few minutes then remove the pod and enjoy.  One Love is smooth and mild with a nutty coffee flavor.  I keep a box of it at work since each pod is individually sealed in a foil pouch.  That way, when I just can\\'t stand another cup of \"work\" coffee, I brew up a cup of One Love and become the envy of all my friends. My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it\\'s age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.<br /><br />This coffee is mild without being weak, and is a nice way to start the day (or finish up a meal and settle with a good book).<br /><br />Good choice for your K-cup pantry. Our senior lab/springer mix has been declining very slowly thanks to the benefits of glucosamine.  Lately, however, a need for a change has become apparent.  She\\'s about 55 - 60 lbs.  She gets one dose each morning that she gobbles down happily.  Her movement is less restricted and she actually broke into a trot the other day.  What a blessing.  She\\'s right on the cusp of the weight suggestions for this product line so we went with the \"under 60 lbs\" dose first in order to get her acclimated to the new supplement.  As she is getting used to them and still exhibits discomfort in her hind end we\\'ll be moving her to the \"over 60 lbs\" dose very soon. I ordered these for party favors for a Minnie Mouse party.  I was worried I would not get any Minnies in my box but we were lucky!  Our package contained 4 Minnies, 3 Mickeys, 2 Daisy Ducks, 2 Plutos, and 1 Donald Duck.  We did not get any Goofys.  I guess you take a chance when you order these but as long as your child has 1 or 2 favorite characters, you should be ok. This review is based on my husband\\'s opinions as he is the hot beverage drinker in our home.  He found this drink to have a tangy bite and was surprisingly refreshing.  He felt this would make a tasty alternative to other breakfast beverages and would also be soothing for someone with a cold.  I noticed that when he opened it up, it had a strong, almost alcohol odor like a rum and coke but that was the only strange thing about it. Every year we host the family Christmas get-together at our house. About 6 months ago we discovered that our son & I are both gluten intolerant and the thought of having to bake stuff that everyone could eat AND enjoy without having to make two versions of everything almost sent me over the edge. I used Pamela\\'s Bread Mix & Flour Blend for cookies, brownies, cakes, rolls, crackers ... EVERYTHING ... and all of the \"normal\" eaters enjoyed the food just as much as my son & I! I\\'m so thankful Amazon has the bulk bags and the subscribe & save. We already used a lot but now that I\\'ve proven just how versatile it can be I know we\\'ll be using even more. Very good taste and for much less calories!! Good price too. Case will go quickly because they are small bags. This sampler was good.  We had plenty of hot chocolate with different flavors to please the kids and adults in the family.  It was a rich chocolate taste and a good value to try the different flavors. I absolutely love these oats! The fact that they are organic just adds to the Love! LOL  I make them every morning for breakfast with cut up prunes, dried cranberries( no sugar) or raisins. Trying to stay away from Sugar so the dried fruit adds just the right flavor. I make it in the microwave in a minute and 1/2 ! I keep the extra bags in the freezer, then store them in the fridge after opening... Highly recommended! If you are looking for something natural to relieve (and possible stop) hot flashes--sage tea will do it. A glass in the morning and one at night and WOW what a difference it made! My sister suggested this tea to me.  I was looking for a good herbal tea to limit my caffeine, and one I could have in the evening.  Most herbal teas seem very weak to me.  I\\'m not a big licorice fan, but this doesn\\'t taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.  It\\'s great in the evening when I\\'m craving something sweet - and no calories or caffeine! This absolutely the Best tasting Coffee in the world. Bold taste along with rich flavor. When folks come over our house and taste our French Market Coffee they get hooked and convert to dedicated French Market Coffee drinkers. I love cheese, especially blue cheese. I was in the Military for 24 years and have seen much of the world. And in most places I visited I would try the local cheeses. Believe it or not the best blue cheese I have tasted is the Roaring Forties Blue from Kings Island cheeses in tasmania Autralia. It has been aged perfectly and has a robust flavor thats hard to find in most blues. I like to let the cheese warm a little at room temperature which allows it to be spred easily on crackers or my favorite, a good french baguette. This cheese is a little higher in price than others but if you want quality it is worth it. Try their website @ kidairy.com.au for more information on products. I agonized over other reviews of dry kefir grains and the pains of reactivating them when I came across this product already activated.  It worked beautifully!  I\\'m so glad I went with this one, especially since I\\'m using expensive goat milk and didn\\'t want to waste it on a few days of activation.  This product started multiplying and making delicious kefir immediately -- the first time took about a day and a half, and since then it takes about 24 hours to make drinkable kefir. Definitely worth the slight extra cost up front! Positively scrumptious. Lives up to its name. I mix it with greek yogurt and have it for breakfast every morning. Beware the Better n Butter addiction, one spoonful and you\\'ll be hooked. My chiropractor suggested that I use goats milk after I was done breastfeeding.  It\\'s very easy to digest and was easy on my baby\\'s tummy. Mix this sauce 50-50 with catsup for a super topping for meatloaf. Not a sauce to cook with but can be added the last 5 mins. amd on the side. Amazing!!!!!! kelloggs Special K red berries is what i have for breakfast for at least 4 years now and i lost weight and stay fit.  I have it with milk and so when i need midnight snack i go for it, too. If you have no time in the morning for a sit down breakfast this cookies are perfect for you. This size packaging fits well in my kitchen cabinet.  The product is fresh and oh so good, as expected for many years. Sardines used to gross me out but these aren\\'t mushy or too stinky like some sardines you can get. I like how neatly packed they are in their little can. I just throw some hotsauce on em and chow down. These are my favorite by far and told my grandfather about them.<br /><br />The other reviews say more about the reviewers than the product. Executive summary: not as good as a traditional cup of Ethiopian coffee, but definitely the best coffee pod coffee I\\'ve ever had.<br /><br />Several years ago I walked into an Ethiopian restaurant for the first time.  The food was good, but the coffee was the best coffee I had ever tasted.  It was rich and dark and so incredibly flavorful.  It didn\\'t pack a killer caffeine punch, which is good, because I drank a whole pot by myself.  I love coffee and drink it daily, and I\\'ve never found another coffee that came close, except at another Ethiopian restaurant.  It\\'s my understanding that coffee originated in that region, which may have something to do with it.  (If I\\'m wrong, sorry--I\\'m not a historian.)<br /><br />While I looked forward to this coffee, I was pretty sure it wouldn\\'t be as good as the coffee in the restaurants, made in the traditional way.  I was right.  Still, this is the best coffee I\\'ve had from a coffee pod.<br /><br />It was rich and dark, as I expected.  The scent that was released when I opened the packet was wonderfully deep and complex.  The first cup, made from the pod, was very good, if a little bland.  The smell while it brewed turned a little unpleasant near the end, for some reason, but it faded quickly and wasn\\'t present in the brewed coffee at all.<br /><br />I took out the coffee press for the second cup, and cut open one of the pods.  (I don\\'t recommend this, since the grind is far too fine for a coffee press.)  The coffee made this way was much richer and more complex, and the scent while it brewed was sweet and tempting.  Two cups of this coffee didn\\'t give me caffeine shakes, so caffeine levels seem about average.<br /><br />If it matters to you, this is Fair Trade Certified coffee and some profits are donated to Kicks For Cause Foundation, which supports youth soccer programs. I\\'ve been eating these for a couple of years now, and my boyfriend finally tried them and now he eats them more than I do!  They\\'re great.  The only issue I have with them is that sometimes the quality is different -- not sure if it\\'s something that happens during manufacturing or afterwards during storage/shipping, but occasionally we\\'ll get some that don\\'t taste as chocolately or are gritty or something.  On the other hand, it helps keep them from all tasting the same.  They\\'re particularly great on the go! This is a fantastic decaf coffee. My parents love decaf but there aren\\'t many out there they enjoy. We\\'ve been drinking Timothy\\'s decaf Colombian and we bought this to try it. Fantastic! I would definitely buy this again and again. It\\'s smooth and not bitter. It\\'s not super strong so don\\'t expect it to be like a cappacino. This is a really great Colombian cup of coffee. You won\\'t miss the caffiene. My dogs love these and so much easier on them than rawhide bones.  I buy these all the time!  And they love peanut butter flavor! Decided to give this a try, and was very pleased.  I have trouble making myself drink enough fluids every day, and this stuff makes it a little easier to do.  The taste is a little strange at first, not quite like coconut water fresh out of a coconut you break open yourself, but it\\'s still pretty good when chilled. These are a really good chips, have a Wonderful flavor, not too salty very light taste of garlic and with a hint of other seasonings, I try these these chips with chiken salad and doesn\\'t taste good at all, but with Guacamole or avocado they taste delicious, This is a quality product you will enjoy I higly recommended. We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer.  It is not as good as A&W root beer but it makes a great root beer float.  It does not taste overly sweet, nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste.  Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit.  I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float! This is a great mix of fruits with apples, pears and bananas. However, it contains 50% more sugar than other Gerber 2nd foods such as Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit and Gerber 2nd Foods Pear & Pineapple (10g of sugar instead of 15g per container)<br />I did not realize how sweet it is until I tasted the food. I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I\\'ve been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that\\'d they\\'d be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I\\'ve tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to\\'s at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren\\'t as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I\\'m trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there\\'s really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it\\'s sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you\\'re eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they\\'re definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there\\'s more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I\\'d strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO\">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay\\'s Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> ) Product stays in good condition because they\\'re individually wrapped. Good if your kid likes bananas because they are wrapped with 4 pieces together. Good for lunch size. We buy these every month - we love them, but when you receive a box labeled assorted and there are only 2 flavors in it, I believe they call that false advertising! Made in a Lello. Easy mix Freezes well & holds to a cone Tastes better than commercial. I\\'m well into the second 12 pack. I bought these first at the store, single packets, and I started using them before my ride home after work. Usually by that time, after 10 hours, I am a little tired anyway, but I have found these give me that much more energy I need to go the distance without tiring before I get home, especially when the temperatures get really hot, high 90\\'s to over 100 degrees.<br /><br />But I also work out with free weights. So one day when I was doing my leg workout, I did my sets of squats before the leg extensions etc., then decided I wanted to do some more squats. So I took a gel about 15 minutes before I was going to tackle it again and found I had a surge of energy to do 4 more sets with heavier weights, after my leg ext\\'s. So yes, these work quite well. The flavors I love the most are Espresso Love , (strange name but great taste) vanilla and chocolate outrage. But that is my preference since I am a lover of chocolate, and like who isn\\'t?<br /><br />Another note, or update, (4-30-2011), I often use these after my workout (with weights) as an energy boost and recovery. Sometimes during a workout for the extra energy, but most likely to use it after. It works great, and at only 100 calories, it is just the right amount.<br /><br />The box is cheaper than buying the singles at the store, so for me it is the best way to go. I am sure there are other sports that could benefit from these gels. Buy it on Amazon\\'s subscription, and the price drops even more. I understand how some may find these slimy, they are, but I found a way to eliminate that. I cannot have gluten but I love my noodles like most of you. I tried these in soup and I truly found them a bit lacking. I remembered a recipe that I used to love, if you can have eggs this is the recipe to try.<br />Wash the noodles really really good and drain on paper towel. I cut them up a bit.<br /><br />Dice one small potato and fry it is a not stick pan with about 1 tablespoon oil. When the potatoes are cooked spread them out evenly, add the noodles spreading them also, let them cook for a a few minutes to allow for some drying. Scramble 4 eggs and pour them over the noodles, do not disturb them, if you can have parmesan cheese sprinkle some on top now, but it will be good without them, I eat them without cheese. Sprinkle about 1 tsp. oregano on top, salt and pepper to taste. Cover and allow the eggs to cook through. If you like, place the skillet under a broiler to brown the top, but it is not necessary. This may serve 4 if you are on a diet and two if not.<br />Slide them onto a plate a slice and serve plain, with ketchup or tomato sauce.<br /><br />I will track this review so if you have any questions don\\'t hesitate, the noodles in this recipe are nice and dry and when combined with the eggs and potatoes you can hardly taste them. You can also make this with other vegetates like asparagus, onions, chives, even sausage, chicken and other meats. Enjoy! tasted okay and i didnt have the jittery energy i sometimes get from regular energy drinks but it wore off quickly. it only gave me a little bit of energy for about an hour. i dont know, these energy drinks effect everyone different. dosent justify spending three dollars at the gas station in my opinion. I purchased these for my kids. I am always purchasing alternatives for chips (that they love so much) and I stumbled upon these. I ordered the variety pack so the kids could experience different flavors and they were so happy when they ate them. I usually purchase Pop chips and Pop corners, but I thought these would be a fun change for my kids and I was right. After they each tried their own bag, they immediately told me how much they liked them and almost everyday during the Christmas break they wanted a bag for their afternoon snack. They have tried all the flavors in the variety pack and I have not heard any objections yet. I tried the sea salt, cheddar and salt and vinegar varieties and enjoyed the flavors of each. If you like Pop chips, then chances are you will like these too. Although the seasoning on the fries are not as intense as the flavoring on Pop chips, I still think these are an enjoyable snack for kids and adults. Sending it back to Amazon.  Most of the cans have large dents in them. The bubble wrap around the cans is fine, the box is fine, so I assume the cans were shipped with the dents. I love this stuff!  I put it on just about every thing I eat.  It\\'s the perfect amount of heat, but not over-powering.  My only complaint is the packaging.  Of the 12 bottle in my order, 2 had been busted open and went everywhere (this stuff turns in to concrete when it dries so it was quite a task to clean the remaining 10 bottles).<br /><br />I realize that this may be more of a complaint better directed to the shipper (i.e. UPS), but as the customer, I feel this is Amazon\\'s battle to wage.  On that topic; I submitted this information to Amazon, along with a couple photos of the mess, but they never even responded with a confirmation, let alone offered a partial refund.  I\\'m not sure why Amazon even bothers to offer a way to submit satisfaction issues if they just ignore it.<br /><br />Regardless, still a great product...I might suggest you just buy it at your local grocery store instead of purchasing it here since there\\'s no guarantee you\\'ll get every thing you paid for from Amazon. I keep these in the house at all times.  They are a fabulous cookie- nice taste, not hard or crumbly.  I also use them as a pie crust.  I put them in the blender to chop them up, then mix in a bowl with melted butter.  I spray my pie dish with non-stick spray before pressing it in the plate.  My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I\\'ve used them with others also and it turns out great.  I\\'ve never used them for baking pies so I can\\'t recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc. I am very happy with this purchase. The product works really well and the price is a bang. You can\\'t go wrong with this product. Its OK. I think that its good coffee I just don\\'t jive with the taste/ My preference is Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  It is never bitter or too strong.  I like coffee, but those strong ones just don\\'t make it with me.  Give me the mild ones any day. I\\'m so glad I went out on a limb and tried this soup.  Even though it it more expensive than most tomato soups, it is actually worth it!  It is now the only tomato soup we buy.  It\\'s just creamy enough, and I love the seasoning!  My toddler son is a very picky eater, but he loves this soup and requests it often.  What are you waiting for... buy this soup- you won\\'t be sorry!! These wafers are awesome, if you like the ones you buy normally in a local grocery store or use to buy you will love these, but be careful, very addictive, just like the others.yummy Great product that is free of gluten. Silk chocolate soymilk seems to have a stronger chocolate flavor than other soymilk I\\'ve tried. The main competing brand of soymilk for me has lately been a brand called ZenSoy, which, despite being lesser known and having a less appealing package, is actually quite delicious as well.<br /><br />Those who prefer a stronger chocolate flavor would probably prefer Silk. Those who prefer a more \"creamy\" chocolate flavor may find ZenSoy chocolate soymilk more to their liking. Personally, I think they are both great and I\\'d be happy drinking either.<br /><br />While Silk seems more chocolatey, I\\'d also say it doesn\\'t seem to taste more sweet. Think dark chocolate vs milk chocolate, perhaps... but the difference is not nearly as noticeable as that. That would be a huge exaggeration. Really though, if you like chocolate milk, either of them would be good choices and I\\'d encourage trying both of them to see which one you prefer.<br /><br />Soy protein is great too since it\\'s high quality complete protein, similar to what you\\'d get in meat. It\\'s even better than meat though since it is not accompanied by all the health risks associated with meat or other animal products. It also beats dairy products handily both in terms of not causing diseases like dairy does, and also because unlike dairy protein, soy protein is complete protein. My dog has a hx. of pancreatitis.  She cannot eat anything with a high fat content (i.e. pig ears).  Her stomach is also very senistive and a lot of other bones and dog chews give her terrible diarrhea.  The Chew-Lotta bones have been a God send for us.  She loves to chew and she gets one Chew-Lotta every week.  She tolerates them well and they usually last for 2-3 days.  This is the best dog treat I\\'ve found. I am avoiding wheat, but used to love Cream of Wheat.  I had been eating pretty low carb, but wanted to add back a few good quality carbs, so I picked this up when I saw it at a local store.  I cooked it in water with sea salt, added some walnuts and frozen berries, and took it to work for lunch.  I heated it up, added a little stevia and some good cream, and it was amazing!  It would also be good with coconut oil, for dairy free good fats, or coconut milk! Yum! I love dark chocolates, the darker the better. However unlike the many other Ghirardelli dark chocolates this one isn\\'t good.<br /><br />The chocolate itself doesn\\'t melt smooth, has bad mouth feel, and is absolutely flavorless. The chocolate actually reminds me of the poor tasting choco-bits in some ice creams, just waxy and lacking of flavor. And it doesn\\'t even taste the same as their regular 60% chocolate. If Ghirardelli would have used the same chocolate as their other filled delights then it would actually taste really good.<br /><br />The caramel filling is the only redeeming quality of the chocolate. Smooth, full flavored, and not overly sticky (like some chocolate makers tend to use).<br /><br />Overall this is a poor quality chocolate that is waxy and flavorless with the only good thing being the caramel filling. Ghirardelli really dropped the ball on this one and am a bit surprised that they allowed it out on the market.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy a different flavor or brand, this is definitely not Ghirardelli at their best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Caramel filling tastes great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Waxy, doesn\\'t melt well.<br />The chocolate itself is flavorless. I followed the directions on the package and still had to spit the mixture out of my mouth, it had more salt than anything I\\'ve ever eaten.  I can\\'t believe what I paid for it! When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has \"organic\" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product \"does not have harmful levels of mercury.\"  I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don\\'t want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth\\'s Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I\\'m sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don\\'t plan to give ours tuna fish. Ever since I attended nursing school, I have been wary of salt. I\\'m trying to cut salt from my diet now while I am young so it isn\\'t difficult to make the shift when I get older. This is an AMAZING product, I can\\'t believe it is salt free. I put it on everything! It would not be useful for baking as there are other added savory spices, but to give foods some zest this is some awesome stuff. Everyone I know is getting one in their stocking this year! The paneer is terrible- tough, chewy, just horrible. The gravy isn\\'t at all bad but nothing like any tikka masala I\\'ve had elsewhere. I\\'ve never written a review before but this was too disappointing. I have been unable to find whole nutmeg in any grocery in my \\'hood at the end of the earth.  I thought the price was more than reasonable for a package, but I incorrectly assumed (because I did not read well) that I would be getting about 12 whole nutmegs, instead of 12 packages of 4-6 nutmegs each.  Thankfully this product will last forever if kept in a cool dry place. I will be sharing with my friends, since I don\\'t believe I could even finish 2 packages by the end of my life. The taste supersedes any of the ground product I have purchased. I ordered this to make cocoa syrup (I used half this stuff and half dutch process cocoa powder)-- it turned into a concoction \"so dark, light cannot escape from its surface\".<br /><br />No, no, I didn\\'t burn it.<br /><br />The syrup was so rich I could only use a teaspoon or two at a time, because the flavor of the cocoa is so powerful. It kept for over two years in the fridge with some crystallization. It\\'s perfect for making hot cocoa or mocha. When I first purchased these beans, I had just gotten a Saeco Automatic Espresso Machine...I love the idea of the manual machines, I\\'m just not prepared to mess with tamping and grinding while I\\'m trying to get out the door in the morning. I have recently been to Italy and very much enjoyed the Lavazza beans I had there. These are nothing in comparison. The other reviews that said they looked and tasted stale- I have to agree. These beans look extremely dry and the flavor is just not there. Trying to order the Gran Filtro Dark Beans to see if they taste any different. When comparing these \"Premium\" beans to a local roaster...it is night and day. Not what I expected and shame on you Amazon for selling stale beans. Do you like, love, crave chocolate, look no further. Rich as an oil tycoon, creamy and to-die -for. Got this for a woman friend and let me tell you , actually I cant, Family friendly sight and all, lets just say she really, really liked these shells and I got some great gifts from her. Can;t do no better as a gift and cheaper then a sports car. She even let me taste one, off the charts in chocolate goodness. All kidding aside, this is one great product and hats off to the amazon people for finding another great product Arrive in great shape, promptly I might add. These Pill Pockets are a must for anyone who has a dog that resists pill administration. I have a 16-yr-old miniature Poodle w/heart & joint issues. He fights taking pills, which isn\\'t good for his bad heart. I put 1/2 Rimadyl tab, 1/2 enalapril tab, & 1/4 tramadol tab in one (1) Pill Pocket! Yes, all of those in 1 pocket. I pinch the pocket around the meds, then roll the pocket in my palms to seal it, & he takes it w/o any resistance! These are absolutely wonderful! I use the chicken flavored, & have tried the duck (when the chicken was out). The duck smelled really bad to me, but the dog didn\\'t seem to mind at all. I highly recommend this product! These bars are the best fiber bars out there---lots of fiber, plus they taste great---very satisfying.  They are crunchy and nutty, not dry or \"card-board\" tasting, like many other bars. We bought these by accident, we thought they were stevia based THEY ARE NOT, that being said, they are delicious. My 11 year old really loves these and they are a bargain. Do I like having sweets around the house, no, that being said these are really good and the flavors are really different. The adults also prefer these to the other brands available (we are taste not price sensitive as we eat so few) even the \"original\" Haribo\\'s so if you want something different and really delicious, these are exceptional. Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn\\'t sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there\\'s cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth. I would have to say this granola is not very flavorful. The raisins don\\'t taste like raisins, that\\'s ho bad it is. Knowing how healthy this product is with 58% DRV of fiber you shouldn\\'t be expecting it to taste good. The lack of taste is tolerable as it\\'s neither disgusting nor exuberantly flavored. These little mints don\\'t let me down. I like them better than the \"full-sized\" Altoids. A kick of cinnamon - what\\'s not to like? These cookies are amazing!  So many \"healthier\" cookies taste like sand.  These remind me of \"Famous Amos\" cookies, but with much better ingredients. This is by far the worst green tea I have ever had.  The quality is so bad that I am considering to toss all my 6 boxes of tea bags into trash.  DO NOT buy. I finally had caved and bought this (sorry this was purchased last year, did not realize mmy review did not publish/go through)..I had heard so many good things about this last year and finally gave it a try. The dog ate it fine, but he eats almost anything. Then it was recalled. Might have given it a higher star rating, but I cannot justify rewarding a product that has been recalled. :( This is the best Sauerbraten mix ever ... and the gravy it makes is wonderful!  Very difficult to find in stores ... so glad to find it on Amazon. The flavor of this energy bar is good,but I was surprised to see such one candy bar when I open the package.I thought I can get a whole box. I purchased this at Whole Foods for $3.63 (and received 10% off because I purchased the case). Most grocery stores will order this for you--and give you 10% off the case price. Usually Amazon\\'s prices beat Whole Foods, but not in this instance.<br /><br />I originally purchased this for the two celiacs in my household (we are 100% gluten-free kitchen) but ended up using it as one of the few foods I could eat when I had a gall-bladder attack (no dairy with it, just added a TB of hemp oil after cooking and a slight drizzle of maple syrup.<br /><br />To make grits I follow directions for water exactly. For hot cereal, I add a bit more water. I expected them to be bigger but the dog loved them just the same so I\\'m happy. Thinking about buying them again. I\\'m not a diabetic, just on a low carb diet. A nutritionist recommended this pasta. I love it, I\\'m a picky eater and I can\\'t tell a difference from normal pasta. I like the taste much better than wheat pasta because it tastes like normal noodles. Zoe is an excellent cooking oil and the metal container promotes its integrity for long shelf life.<br />It is also useful for other processes calling for olive oil. We have had problems with our cat and her food in the past. She was having a few health issues so with some advice from the vet we decided to go with a more natural food than Science Diet. Like humans natural foods are better because they contain more of the vitamins and nutrients that the body needs. Our cat loves this food. She doesn\\'t get ear infections or have feline acne anymore. She also have more energy and overall happier. The only downfall with it is that it is quite a bit more expensive than Science Diet or the like. However, I would much rather spend a little more for food than pay hundreds at the vet for preventable issues. This organic beef is by far my cat\\'s favorite can food.  He gobbles it down instantly, which is not true with any other can cat food I give him.  I don\\'t use this everyday (about every 3 or 4 days) because I like to feed a variety of foods to Butch.  I also feed him dehydrated raw food, but at a separate time from the can. This product sounded great. I love flavored coffees! But, this is just too weak for my taste. The blueberry overpowers any coffee taste, except to leave behind a horrid aftertaste of not quite coffee. I wish it had been a more robust roast to really hold the flavor together. I use McCann steel cut Oat Meal as a soaker for natural artisan sourdough breads (Maple Oatmeal Bread) and it adds terrific flavor and texture to the loaves.  The product also makes a great breakfast cereal. This is just a seasoning, not a magic wand to make kimchee.<br /> Making up the steps and modifying as you go along is not going to make kimchee. Just follow the directions exactly.<br /> If you have ever made sauerkraut at home, you know what I mean. The first step, which is salting, is going to make the cabbage salty. So then you rinse off the salt very well, drain, and proceed to the next step, which is the seasoning step.<br /> Be prepared to appreciate the flavor for what it is - not a replication of whatever kimchee you already bought bottled at the store. I wanted to try this food for my cats since it is mostly turkey meat without byproducts. I prefer to purchase pet foods that say they are made with food fit for human consumption as I don\\'t want to purchase something with questionable, low-quality ingredients. I would  prefer a food without any grains, but they are at a minimum in this food. So it is mostly meat.<br />My cats happily eat this, save for the two who only touch canned food if it\\'s primarily fish. I add their vitamin supplement and a little water to it.<br />It does have a bit of an odor, but pate style cat foods normally do. It\\'s not overwhelming or bad like typical grocery store cat foods. I\\'ve been looking for a low acid coffee for some time & this lives up to all the claims.  I can actually drink coffee again!  It isn\\'t the best coffee I\\'ve ever tasted, but the benefit of being able to drink coffee again far out weighs taste.  I will be ordering more. My chihuahuas like this treat, but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. They hesitate and let it sit quite often. Im not too good about getting my fresh fruit everyday.  However, this stuff makes it easy to get your fruit in.  They say it offers about 90% of the nutritional value of fresh fruit.  Much better than other freeze dried fruit Ive had, this stuff isnt chalky. I love Lindt chocolate.  The milk chocolate/hazelnut and the milk chocolate truffles are some of the BEST chocolates I\\'ve eaten in my lifetime and I will be forever grateful that they exist.<br /><br />However, as I\\'m no spring chicken, the extra calories aren\\'t doing me any favors so I decided to \"go healthy\" by having little bits of dark chocolate at a time instead of gobbling down an entire milk choc/hazelnut bar.<br /><br />This DC/Black Currant bar is delicious.  It\\'s smooth, not bitter and it has bits of sweet currants and crunchy almonds for texture.  The fruit taste is obvious, but not overwhelming, and I am happy with a 1 square after supper to satisfy my sweet tooth.<br /><br />Definitely recommend! They are ok bcoz this has strawberry which are really sour and when you eat them with milk it does not taste good. It is tasty and healthy.  While nothing is as good as fresh popcorn out of the pan, this comes close and it is a lot easier to open the bag and have a healthy snack. This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn\\'t find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful. save your money and buy any other tea out there. My dog sometimes eats this and sometimes walks away. What can I say...looks good to me, but hes the dog. Our dog loves this line of treats.  He tends to be a meat eater and doesnt like cookie based treats.  He loves these treats in all of the flavors but esp duck and salmon. Over the past few weeks, I was analyzing my typical daily nutrition and found I was lacking in magnesium. Like most Americans, I consume much more calcium than magnesium; the ratio of calcium to magnesium intake ideally needs to be 1-1.5:1. I read the reviews and thought it would be interesting to see if I could experience the calming effect on my muscles that many other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />I take two teaspoons (dissolved into a 500 mL water bottle) about an hour before I go to bed, and I do notice a calming effect. This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to \"knock you out.\" Rather, I do experience a noticeable \"lightening\" of the muscles. As I lie in bed, I feel more comfortable and better able to focus on feeling comfortable because the muscles all throughout my body seem to be content to be in \"off\" mode; they are not as easily excitable as they are on my previously magnesium-deficient diet.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product and will continue taking two teapoons in water every night. I recommend this product to all who have found that they, too, are deficient in magnesium. I also agree that this product softens the stools and provides for a pleasant midday defecation. Cheers. I have tried several of these Hormel Compleats and am VERY satisfied.  So much so I have ordered 24 more.  I find they are inexpensive, fast to prepare (90 seconds), and taste very good for a quick microwave light meal.  I would advise that you have a little salt & pepper handy as they are made a bit bland to meet most tastes. I have these 2 or 3 times a week at work as it saves $$ on going out to a local fast food outlet and is still a good small meal. This is great stuff and makes the best jerky. I use it all the time and the flavor is awesome. It is hard to get just one falvor of this product. I was very happy to order 48 pouches. However, when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead. I could not return but Amazon gave me a total refund. If you are ordering this, wait about 10 days (after 9/1/12)so you don\\'t receive Mixed Grill like I did. It was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments. Fog Chaser has a very good flavor, and it is reasonably strong especially for a K-Cup.  I like it better than their French Roast version, which seems stronger but more harsh to me; and I like very strong coffee.  Their Rainforest version has a more mellow taste that is also very good, but it is weaker strength than Fog Chaser.  The price for any of the versions, especially for the \"subscribe and save\", is very good.  The packaging, which is a box of 3 sealed bags of 12 is fine to deal with; once you open a sealed bag (you can\\'t reseal the bag), just use a ziplock to seal the remainder for the week. First ingredient listed is chicken. Price is less then grocery and pet stores. Would recommend for older less active dogs. My baby is a picky eater and LOVES, especially this flavor.  I try everything that I give her and these are something I would eat too! I am a vegetarian trying my best to move to veganism, but it is difficult to find yummy alternatives for my favorite foods. This oatmeal has hit the vegan nail on the head. It is delicious but also convenient and affordable. The serving size is plenty ample for a morning meal. Will definitely be purchasing more of these in other flavors! My 15 year old daughter has just been diagnosed as gluten intolerant so we are on the quest to find as \"normal\" of food as we can.  This pasta definitely fits the bill - tastes great, just like semolina pasta. I\\'m very happy my sister told me about it - it will be our pasta of choice from now on. I don\\'t know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he\\'s hungry and leaves the rest.  He\\'s never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I\\'ve read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn\\'t lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I\\'ve found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he\\'s got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don\\'t mind making it tasty. I love the taste of these bars and the oat health that goes along with eating them! I do purchase these items on a semi regular basis. That said, two things hold me back from buying and eating them more often: 1) The calories are high (but the texture and taste make it worth it) and 2) The price point is still a bit high. I feel like for the cost of a handful oats as the primary ingredient that paying over $2.30 per 3.0 oz bar is too much. The Planters big nut bars are ok. They aren\\'t too sweet, and actually I would have liked them to be just a little sweeter. They were not as crunchy as I thought they would be for having nuts in them. It could use more nuts than what are in them. I thought they were a bit bland tasting myself, but then again, different people have different tastes. I had my husband and my 10 year old try them. My husband really liked them as he is a HUGE peanut eater. My 10 year old liked them, but said she would only want one once in a great while. I agree with my daughter in the fact I wouldn\\'t want them too often either. So, while they may be good for a quick snack they probably would not be something I would buy very often. They would probably be good to pack for a camping trip for a special treat. I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn\\'t cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging. I first tried this powder at the Dole plantation in Hawaii. They sprinkled it on pineapple bits and passed out samples. It was amazingly good, and totally changed the taste of the pineapple. Of course, I bought some and took it back home with me, where I passed it around to family members. Although I experimented using it on other fruit, my favorite is still the pineapple. My mother really likes it on oranges. But it\\'s good on apples and other fruit, too. I\\'ve bought some every time I\\'ve returned to Hawaii, and I\\'ve had friends pick some up for me on their trips. I was glad to find out that I can now order it online, because I haven\\'t been able to find it on the mainland. It gets a high rating from me and from my family. My son plays AAA hockey and sometimes has to play up to 3 games in a day. We do not let him drink soda (total junk), but do not mind if he drinks T4G on heavy hockey days. It does have some caffeine in it, but since it\\'s specially formulated for kids, he isn\\'t getting too much. We\\'ve found that he seems to focus better and more quickly after drinking one of these. He likes the taste and several of his teammates have sampled it as well and liked it. Glad to see someone decided to put GRANULAR Splenda in a larger package!<br /><br />The Splenda \"in the bag\" is DIFFERENT from that in packets!  It contains<br />maltodextrin -- as do the packets.....BUT NO DEXTROSE!  Dextrose, and sucralose, (the main ingredient), are both SUGARS...but Sucralose, of course, is sugar with a hydrogen atom changed for a carbon atom, (or some such thing)....and so a new, safer \"sugar\" results!  No \"cloying\" taste, when used to excess, as \"real\" sugar has.  So, sucraLOSE, though a sugar, is a sugar of \"a different sort\"...a safer sort, for diabetics and pre-diabetics.  Granular Splenda has ONLY Sucralose and Maltodextrin...whilst the PACKET variety ADDS the Dextrose....Another form of sugar which is NOT as safe, (for diabetics and pre-diabetics), as sucralose is!  (If you don\\'t believe me that a different formula is in each variety, read the labels, as I did!)<br /><br />This said, I have heard my sister say that there is research that sucralose COULD lead to a shortening of \"t\" cells in the body...the cells that grow shorter, anyway, as we age.  So, imbibing sucralose -- in any form -- could shorten life...according to what my sister has heard and said, anyway.  How much it shortens life -- if at all -- is something I don\\'t know.  What I DO know is that diabetes -- in any form -- can definitely shorten life, if not treated properly!  I\\'m a pre-diabetic -- who actually got Type II -- then lost it, (because I lost 30 pounds!)  This may not work for everyone...but it did work for me, so I pass the info on.  A quite thin friend of mine has Type II.  She also has a very negative attitude towards life.  Losing weight obviously will not help her.  Having a more optimistic, (yet still realistic) attitude will.  But it\\'s hard to convince nt negatively-minded friend of this.  Hopefully, this advice of trying to be more positive -- and also losing weight, if possible -- can help others.  Nope -- life isn\\'t perfect for anyone.  But if you sit down, and list the 10 best things in your life in one column, and the 10 worst things in another, you\\'ll see how things balance out, and hopefully, get a more realistically-positive view on life!  Hopefully, too, this realistically-positive attitude -- combined with excercise and diet -- can help regulate...or, perhaps, eventually eliminate, any person\\'s case of diabetes.  Certainly, excercise, good thoughts, losing weight, and correct diets, can\\'t hurt.  Even using Splenda Granulated can\\'t hurt -- too much -- if one cuts down, just a bit.<br /><br />All in all, Splenda Granuated is a great product, and I\\'m SO glad to see it is now in the \"super-economy\" size.  When I looked at the \"5-pound equivalent bag\", I noticed Amazon isn\\'t sellong that any more.  But a notice that the larger-size bag IS being sold on Amazon, should be mentioned there!  Splenda Granulated, even if does break down T-cells (quickly or slowly...I don\\'t know), is still a great product!  Use in moderation -- or as moderately as you can -- though! Very good hot chocolate.  I have tried a few different brands, and this one is the best I have tried.  Should be priced higher for the quality you get. Switch is the \"all natural\" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C. The flavor in question is watermelon strawberry.  This soda had a very clean and crisp taste, yet it didn\\'t taste like watermelon or strawberry.  I had a hard time trying to pinpoint what this carbonated beverage tasted like.  After I finished I came to the conclusion that it tasted a lot like blueberry or raspberry, not watermelon-strawberry (watermelon or strawberry).  The end result is this soda is very good but doesn\\'t taste like its name. My husband loves the green and white fusion tea!! He rates it excellent! I have not tried it as of yet, but of all he has tried this is the one for him. Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Dog treats are delicious! Well, at least my dog thinks so. A great training aid. I could not find these treats in the stores anymore so was thankful to find them on Amazon.  My cat Puff loves them. The peanut butter mixer works well. Although it does take more time to get it thoroughly mixed than I thought it would. It sure beats cleaning the mess I made on the counter stirring it with a knife. I had received a Keurig coffee maker for the holidays and have been hooked since. I am not a real strong coffee person so this morning blend is perfect. Consistant in flavor. The only reason I gave it a four is once you buy the machine you are basically locked into buying the cups.. It does have the reusable pod tho. I believe the prices could come down. In the store the prices are outrageous, but on Amazom they are reasonable somewhat.. I bought cases of the large bags of Buffalo Bleu, New York Cheddar and a medium sized case of Spicy Thai.  The cheddar kind of tastes like pringles to me, but the others in my family really like them.  The thai is really good, but they aren\\'t that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu\\'s were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer. This hot chocolate is great am so glad I doubled the order ,you can not miss with this .Now I have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids Nothing wrong with the product but should be packaged with some kind of free-flowing agent as tends to lump and cake very easily in humid weather, even when tightly closed! This is nice bottled water. It does have minerals added - and the taste is slightly different. It reminds me of \"soft\" water. So if you like that type of taste or prefer it, then this is for you. If you like a crisper (the only way I know hoe to describe it) or \"harder\" water, then you wont like it.<br /><br />The other good news, is that the bottle it self is strong, like the old water bottles used to be. Not like the thin flimsy stuff you get today. So if you like to reuse your water bottles (like me) this one is great! I picked up a box of the blueberry treats while vacationing in DC as a treat for the dogs. I loved the tiny size because we\\'re doing a lot of training at the moment and the dogs were putting on weight (two toy poodles and a Lab#. Who knew that all three would be crazy for the blueberry treats - all three run to the cookie dish and sit patiently until they get a couple of blueberry bones #they are small treats which allows me to give two or three treats instead of breaking one into pieces). Even the Lab, who has had weight issues for years, loves these treats. Who knew dogs liked blueberries! Those are the best crackers/snacks for little ones. They do not crumble so no mess and they dissolve very easy so babies don\\'t choke. I started giving those rusks to my 5.5 months old twins, they loved them, my 2.5 year old toddler also likes them alot. They taste great. We tried original and vegetable flavors, both are good. I\\'ve been ordering them on the regular basis. Great for to go in the stroller or in the car. I can not even think of drinking any other coffee! It is better than any specialty coffee from and shop or coffee house. Can\\'t be beat. These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though. Way too yummy and now i need to spend way too much time in the gym :+# I do a lot of hiking and camping, and have used quite a few dried products from Barry Farms. If you don\\'t mind the taste of dried dairy and veggie products, there is just about nothing you will not find that they haven\\'t managed to dry and bag.  Most of the products by them I came into acquaintance with way back when my son was a youngin\\' and in the scouts and we did a lot of camping.  A few of the products have stayed with me as extra tasty and versatile now that I am tending to face the savage wilderness alone.  Barry\\'s red bell pepper is one of the best items to have along on a hike, or just to have included in any survival kit.  Bell peppers dress up and add some spice to just about any meat, fish, or stew that you can manage to put together out in the wilderness. And as already noted in the other review, dried products such as this last literally for years without spoiling. This dried pepper is for some reason a lot more favorable to me than genuine bell pepper.  A lot of dried products from Barry Farms have spices added, so perhaps it is the excellent garnish they use.  In any event, a little of this pepper goes a long way.  So don\\'t let the small 2 oz package fool you.  I not only recommend this to add some fine flavoring to whatever campfire cooking you encounter, but I also recommend checking out some of the products by Barry Farms.  They\\'re not all worth it or as flavorful, but most of them are.  And like the other reviewer here, I also recommend you buy several products at once and save a bundle on the shipping.  Recommended... After trying Artisana\\'s Cacao Bliss, I wanted to sample some of the manufacturer\\'s other products.  I really enjoy macademia nuts and thought the Macadamia with Cashews butter would be a good product to try.  This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.<br /><br />Unlike Cacao Bliss, which is a solid product at room temperature, the macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container.  There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices; the product is incredibly smooth out of the jar.  When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture.  This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer.  I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.<br /><br />While not noted explicitly on the product\\'s label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product.  There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is \"made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO\\'s.\"<br /><br />This is my second good experience with Artisana products.  For holiday gift giving, I\\'m definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana\\'s products in gift baskets.  They are tasty, natural and unique.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States I would buy it online again only if I couldnt find it where I am.<br />I didnt know the actual price of this product in the stores.<br />Now i know it is over prized. I was hoping to save some of my shoes and some money. Rawhides scare me, kongs require effort and increased calories and I had heard good things about Nylabones. My dog will not touch the originals and will occasionally chew on the chocolate one for a couple of minutes. I wouldn\\'t get the value pack before confirming that my dog A. likes Nylabones and B. likes the originals. If you\\'re insistent on getting these and you have a chewer, I would consider going a size up.<br /><br />I ended up getting a naturally shed deer antler - they cost a little more but last a really long time, don\\'t get dirty like nylabones, are odorless and are actual bones so the vast majority of dogs like them. If you can find the ones that are cut through the middle so they expose more marrow - your dog will probably be entertained for longer periods of time. Bully sticks are also pretty much a guaranteed hit, although my boyfriend calls them butt sticks because of the terrible smell. Comment if you find something else that works. :)<br /><br />Update: While the nylabone still isn\\'t his favorite - He does chew the chocolate one a little longer after I took it away and pretended that it was my phone a few different times. It also seems that it becomes more interesting after he chewed the outside lawyer some and gave it some texture. I\\'ve been drinking Chai\\'s for over 5 years now.  This is one of the best Chai Concentrate\\'s I\\'ve tasted.  I do like mine a little more spicy, but simmering with some cloves and minced ginger gives it that extra spice I love.  Can\\'t beat the price and exceptionally fast shipping. I have only been using this product for a week and haven\\'t seen the health benefits yet (weight lost and lower cholesterol) but I love the taste and have been replacing 2 meals a day. I love sweet tea, but my waistline does not.  So I buy this tea, brew it over ice, and add simple syrup that I make with Splenda.  Not as good as sugar, but after a while, you almost forget what the \"real stuff\" tastes like.  I do love these little k-cups.  They brew a stron enough tea that as it melts the ice you brew it over, it still tastes like tea when it\\'s done - not watered down.  They\\'d be \"perfect\" if they were less expensive, and if Keurig came up with a way to make them compostable (like making them from corn products, maybe?).  I hate that I\\'m throwing away this little piece of plastic every day. This is a great product; tastes great, much healthier than regular commercial peanut butter.  Unfortunately, it is also available everywhere else on the internet for $3.99 while it\\'s nearly $12 on Amazon.  I notified Amazon of this 300% difference in price nearly two months ago and they assured me they would look into it.  No adjustment to the price has been made and I would assume at this point, that it won\\'t be.<br /><br />Buy the product but buy it anywhere else. I never had high hopes for the organic products that I bought...very often flavorless and grainy textures.  Boy, were we surprised by Bionaturae!!!  The texture, flavor and cooking are perfection.  I have already ordered the other pastas...parpardelle, penne, etc.  I find that you need to add about 1 minute more to the cooking time, but you get scrumptous results.  My husband, a typical spaghetti man, has now come up with recipes for the thicker, noodle like pastas and is a convert!!  Wonderful products. There are 3 flavors - both my cats loved one flavor (whitefish), one would eat all flavors (though not happy about the salmon), and one cat rejected 2 out of 3.  The can size is perfect for picky cats - less waste. Before eating my first \"Pamela\\'s Gluten-free Whenever Bar; Oat Raisin Walnut Spice,\" I was mentally preparing to provide a list of all the technical details I would be listing in my review.  Then I had a bite.<br /><br />These odd little \"bars\" (its not really a bar, since it lacks a defined rectangular shape) taste just like my Grandmother\\'s ginger cookies.  Everything else I would have said pales in comparison.  Basically, if you taste like grandma used to make, that sort of trumps everything else, and you get five stars.<br /><br />Warning: They taste really good, and knowing that you are eating something carefully designed to be very healthy and organic, its tempting to have more that the two I have budgeted for lunch today.<br /><br />The first one had a huge piece of walnut in the end.  The second one was heavy on raisins.  Each one appears to have its own character, as if they are made in small, individual batches.  List of ingredients on the side:  Gluten-free oats, organic agave, rice blend (mostly brown rice flour), coconut sugar, raisins, mono-saturated safflower oil, organic eggs, walnuts, coconut, chic seeds, natural vanilla, spices, baking soda, sea salt, xanthan gum, grainless and aluminum free baking powder.<br /><br />I have to admit I\\'m a big gluten fan.  Sometimes I bake bread on weekends and I knead the dough by hands.  I love stretching it out into thin films and I can literally manipulate the gluten to maximize the chewy texture in the resulting loaf.  But 1% or so of the world\\'s population suffers from an abnormal immune reaction to partially digested gliadin. For those folks, this kind of product is a great alternative to traditional carbohydrates.<br /><br />But for folks who don\\'t have a problem with gluten like me, this a very high quality, great tasting convenience food. We really enjoyed this and could not beat the price anywhere! I would highly recommend  this to anybody who enjoys cider. Like most women, I\\'m always on the lookout for that next really great beauty product, whether it be a cosmetic, a perfume, or a hair product. One of the basics for me is having healthy, pretty hair. When I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, I was intrigued. The name implies something very basic and healthy without too many chemicals.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it had not been packaged well. Where the conditioner (which was sent in a separate package) had the dispenser taped down and the entire bottle wrapped in plastic, the shampoo was merely wrapped in plastic. Without the tape holding the dispenser closed, the shampoo leaked all in the plastic during shipping. On a good note, the plastic wrapping proved good enough to contain the leakage so that it didn\\'t even touch the cardboard box.<br /><br />When I removed the plastic, I was immediately stunned at the pungent perfume smell of the leaked shampoo. I had expected something light and `clear\\' and not this heavy perfume stench. Once I finished washing the bottle off, the scent stayed on my hands for hours afterwards, lasting through several thorough hand washings. For someone like me who prefers most products to be unscented, this was a huge turnoff.<br /><br />Although the shampoo has a heavy perfume scent, it isn\\'t quite as bad when used in the hair as it had been when it was leaked out of the bottle. It is still a stronger scent than I like, but not as bad as I feared.<br /><br />The shampoo washes fine but I have to say that it doesn\\'t do any better than the Pantene Shampoo that I have used for some time. It also doesn\\'t seem to make any difference in my hair\\'s volume than my Pantene offers.<br /><br />Once this bottle is finished, I will return to Pantene. I prefer it\\'s lighter, fresh scent and am very satisfied with how it cleans my hair. I have been using Pamela\\'s for over 3 years and love it! The only thing I don\\'t like it for is pancakes, ironically. They seem to come out heavy and doughy. I love Bob\\'s Red Mill pancake mix better. But for everything else I love Pamela\\'s. I make lemon bars, pumpkin bread and muffins, orange chocolate-chip scones, the chocolate chip cookies on the back, sugar cookies, brownies, and lots more. I have never had a bad result, and often my family can\\'t tell any difference between these and wheat-based baked goods. When taking baked goods made with Pamela\\'s people often ask for recipes not even knowing they are gluten-free. One gluten-eating person even bought a bag of Pamela\\'s from me to try my pumpkin muffins. Definitely worth the $! My husband has celiac disease and this is a product that he can use.  Pancakes are the best and he enjoys them very much, This is not a drink or something I drink every day, But when I feel the need for a yummy treat I love it Awesome texture, not a traditional strong honey flavor...more subtle and a nice anmount of sweetness...you WILL find yourself with a tablespoon in hand just licking...guaranteed! This is nothing like honey you grew up on...unless you grew up on a bee farm.  super good. It\\'s hard to find this peach flavored black tea in the market. I was glad to find it online and at a good price. My vet told me to have my dog get these to help with her teeth and she loves them I\\'ve tried the Buffalo flavor and loved them.<br />They taste great all by themselves or tossed in a salad.<br />Then I saw they had jalapeno.<br />Anything with jalapeno and I start drooling all over myself.<br />I saw.<br />I bought.<br />I ate.<br />I cried...they were all gone.<br />I bought more.<br />(Brian doing happy jalapeno dance).<br />Delicious.<br />Unhealthy.<br />Who cares.......recommended. These Nonni\\'s Biscotti \"Originali\" are truly great tasting and, surprisingly, only have 90 calories each! My wife found these at local specialty store and they have quickly become a favorite when we sit down for coffee or tea.<br /><br />The almond flavor is perfect and the individual wrapped \"cookies\" keeps them fresh even after the box is opened.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH Ever since I was a child I have loved Slim Jim Meat Sticks.  The slightly spicy juice that comes out each time you snap into one of these bad boys is enough to convert even the hardest heart.  True, they do leave a waxy residue in your mouth, and it helps to drink something with it to wash it down, but you can\\'t deny the flavor.  The smooth, exciting design of the meat stick makes it feel good in your mouth, as there are no jagged or rough edges, as is normal in your run-of-the-mill jerky-type snacks.  Plus, they are fun to eat!  I have never had such a great time as when I\\'m ramming meat stick after meat stick into my mouth, and sucking the juice out of this tasty meat.  They\\'re so much fun to eat that you can stay home all night just eating these, and still have a better time than if you were to go out on the town.  In fact, I have considered throwing Slim Jim Meat Stick parties, where all we do is gather together and eat meat sticks.  I\\'m entirely serious about this.  They are that good!  And with Amazon\\'s Subscribe & Save feature, you don\\'t even have to worry about constantly re-ordering them.  You can have them sent automatically to your house every month!  A great deal for a great snack! I have lost 85 pounds and Ideal sweetener has helped. I tried every artificial sweetener and this is the only one I will use. I love to bake with it. It tastes great with no aftertaste. The one problem I had was leaving a baked item on my counter and when I left the room my dog jumped up and ate it. This product is poison to dogs. It has a warning on the label. Luckily we took her to the vet right away and $1000 later she was fine. I still use Ideal but I label everything I bake with it and keep it out of reach of my dogs. A few years back this butter was much more available (I used to buy it in Acme). Then it disappeared... like three-to-five years ago, I\\'d guess. There\\'s nothing critical I can say about this butter: it\\'s better than any other kind I\\'m aware of in that it\\'s very flavourful in addition to whatever else. I get it (for four-nintety-nine) at Whole Foods (no shipping of course: quite a savings compared to this page). Also, if you search this site, you\\'ll find reports that it gets shipped unrefrigerated, so there are good chances you\\'ll get a spoiled product. At the store, otoh, it is of course, stored in a refrigerated section and is guaranteed to be good. I love this butter and recommend it very highly; it\\'s the best kind I know (not for cooking of course, it\\'s too expensive, and you lose the flavour). Great stuff, head and shoulders above any typical supermarket stuff, even better than the Irish butter (which is great but not as full-flavoured). As a 100-year-old vinegar, this is a wonderful addition to your gourmet pantry.  I drizzle it on chunks of Parmigiano-Reggiano, berries, Cheetos, walnuts, and other high-class foods.  I also have a hardwood floor, and adding 1 teaspoon of this vinegar to a gallon of water makes a good floor cleaner also. These candy bars were old and stale.  I should have been able to return them. They were not eatable.  I am very turned off by your store now!!!!!!!!!!!!  I want my money back!! These are the best rice cakes I\\'ve tried. They actually have taste and a light crisp texture. They do tend to be a bit crumbly, but overall really good. I go through a package of them in a couple of days and I have not had any problem with them going stale before I can eat them up. We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it\\'s pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked! This product is just as it states, just remember it will not work until you draw all the moisutre our of your sea salt. (meaning work in your pepper mill or grinder) To do so, heat oven to 250, put salt on baking sheet, put in oven, turn oven off...Simple This product came extremely fast by USPS. The product was packaged really well. And for the product itself: I loved it, well worth the price. I\\'ve always enjoyed drinking the pure Coconut water. Tried this blend when it\\'s on sale. It\\'s okay. But I liked the pure one better. I bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper, and I made some as soon as I got them. It is the best popcorn I\\'ve had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn\\'t. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It\\'s better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won\\'t need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you\\'ll be popping like us. BEWARE! All the previous reviews about how great this product is - are all right on. One reviewer noted that his shipment had a short expiration date. We noted it but went ahead and ordered 2 cases to qualify for the free shipping. When we received them, they all had an expiration date 7 months from receipt. 12 bottles of 16oz Red Wine - gulp! They will probably be OK some past that date but you should know about the expiration date. I called Kraft and found that they \\'fresh\\' date Red Wine ** 8 months ** from the bottling date; so if you can\\'t use what you\\'re ordering in that time - take care. This is very yummy, super soft bread. I used it for both pizza crust and loaf bread and am very pleased. Will order other varieties soon! You cannot go wrong with this cereal. I had sworn off cereal because of the hunger I often felt only two hours after breakfast! With Uncle Sam cereal, because it is low glycemic - no hunger. However, eating it without a sweetener will take some getting used to, and is an acquired taste. Personally, I eat it with Splenda and it\\'s yummy! I usually get my cereal in two days - never had a problem. Amazon Prime is definitely worth it. I\\'m not going to say that this low sodium version tastes bad--because it doesn\\'t.  BUT there\\'s enough of a difference from the regular version for me to opt out of this low sodium version.  It\\'s just bland and I can\\'t get through bowl without adding my own salt.  If you have dietary restrictions, then this is a good option.  Otherwise, buy the regular version or be prepared to add your own salt. First, let me throw this caveat out there: I have not tasted the finished product yet, but based on the taste at bottling, I have no problems recomending this product. I added this can of HME after boiling 2 lbs of dark DME and 1 lb of light brown sugar. I left it in the primary fermenter for 3 weeks. Normally I only do a 2 week fermentation, but I gave this an extra week because of the adjunct sugar. The taste at bottling was a typical roasty bitterness associated with stouts. The coffee-like bitterness lingered at the end. I can\\'t wait to try a small bottle of this in a month or so. The rest will wait for St. Patrick\\'s Day.<br /><br />Starting out with HME is the easiest way to make good beer and this is a quality product to do so with. We bought them for our daughter\\'s gluten free diet. We can\\'t help eating them  ourselves. That reminds me ... I need to order another box. My dog loves these flossies and he is picky about treats and things to chew on.  My vet also said they are good for him to chew on because they help prevent plaque build up on his teeth. I\\'m sure there is a crowd out there that just isn\\'t satisfied with regular tobasco or other standard cayanne hot sauces any more, but might hurt themselves if they walk into a shop that exclusively sells hot sauce and says \"give me your hottest!\"  If you are looking to take a baby step, step up to Tobasco Habanero.<br /><br />I love my hot sauce and have been know to put sauces in the 50k to 300k or higher scoville range on my food, but I keep this around to splash on my food if I need a little pep and I dont have a hotter sauce handy.  This sauce ranks in the 7k - 8k scoville range.  Since its more widely available, its a good sauce to help you spring board into other hotter sauces without having to leave the grocery store.  If you want to take a little bit bigger step without getting too burned, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG566\">Blairs Original Death Hot Sauce, 5 fl oz</a> (30k scoville). Putting aside that this is a half decaf coffee, this is the best tasting Kcup I have found.  Most Kcups leave a bitter after taste, mostly due to the fact that the water is not hot enough.  This coffee is flavorful, as strong as a medium roast yet does not have a bitter taste. I highly recommend this Kcup. This is my third order for these noodles.  They aren\\'t like regular noodles, but if you\\'re a pasta fan and you are trying to cut back drastically on calories-this noodle is for you.<br /><br />Don\\'t get apprehensive of the taste in relation to the smell of the packaging water.  Make sure you rinse them very well.  They are GREAT with spaghetti sauce and go very well with sauteed vegetables and any other seasonings you\\'d like to add.  These noodles absorb much flavor (if dried properly) and really fill you up<br /><br />And they are calorie-FREE.  I still don\\'t know how that\\'s possible, but they really help me out when I\\'m needing a snack but close to my calorie count for the day! The first time I tasted anything from Yamamotoyama was at Epcot Center in their Japanese exhibit. I thought that only Epcot would sell the teas, but then found out otherwise. This style of green tea is delectable, down to the last drop. It\\'s not to strong, and not to weak. I usually drink this style with milk and sugar, sorta like an Earl Grey, but it can be drank anyway you prefer. A great buy! This is it, look no further if you want a healthy, holistic dog food which supports  your dog immune system and keeps her weight under control. My dog was 2-3 pounds overweight and i had a very hard time finding a dog food which is good in nutritions and its low in fat. After 1 month my dog became lean and much more energized eating wellness healthy weight dog food. I believe all overweight dogs should be on this diet, its trully wonderful! I\\'ve tried other brands to help my dog lose those extra pounds, along with long walks, but this is the best! The best holistic weight management dog food. I just transitioned my 8 month GSD to the duck recipe.  I was using Orijin Large Breed Puppy previously for the grain free/low calcium aspect.  However, it was difficult to find and really expensive.  After researching different brands, I found this one.  Again, it is grain free and low calcium, high quality ingredients and about $10 - $12 less than Orijin!  My dog transitioned very easily and really quite quickly.  I was surprised she didn\\'t have the loose stools that some have experienced while transitioning.<br /><br />In addition, I am finding that I am actually giving her less food than the Orijin.  She is satisfied at 3/4c - 1c.  With Orijin, she wasn\\'t satisfied until she had almost 2 cups.  I thought she was eating less because she didn\\'t like it, so I added a few things to it and she would still stop at 3/4c - 1c.<br /><br />Her coat is amazingly shinny and I have found that she is shedding less. These chips are the best. Better than regular potato chips. So good in fact I am going to order more I keep a carton of these in the fridge for \"time-crunch\" occasions.  When one of us has an early morning doctor\\'s appointment, for example, we grab a bar to eat in the car or after the doc\\'s visit.  A crunchy, nutty, nutritious, energy bar at 170 calories that tastes good is definitely something I\\'ll keep buying.  Until I found them on Amazon.com, it was touch and go as to whether or not I could get them at all.  Very few places carry Kashi bars.  [...] I tried the plain coffee candies from Bali\\'s Best and they are excellent.  True, deep coffee flavor and very smooth, not too sugary sweet.  I ordered these assortment jars because I also wanted to try the espresso and latte center variations.  I am a coffee addict and these are terrific. I sent these flowers to my Mother for her birthday. They wilted in a day or two and the buds never opened. Yes, it\\'s probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you\\'re looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you\\'re NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it\\'s a great buy. It\\'s not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It\\'s not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy! The Xlear Spry Sugar Free Gum Cinnamon is one of our favorites. It replaced Dentyne because of its non-melting hard shell and sugar free ingredient. I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn\\'t, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or \"burnt\" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time. After trying several brands of chai, including Bigelow, Stash, and even some expensive Tazo, I have settled on this Celestial Seasonings blend. Most chais I find to be either too bitter or bland. This one is neither. The cinnamon and vanilla add just the right note of sweetness. If you have never been a fan of chai, try Celestial Seasonings India Spice, and you might just change your mind! I can\\'t get enough and I hope they never stop making it! My cats like this flavor of Weruva best, out of all the ones I have brought to them.  However, I can\\'t seem to find any made in the USA, as it once was...which is a bit of a downer.  I can only find it made in Thailand. This Switch Kiwi Berry ought to be on the DEA\\'s list of banned substances it is so good.  Every one of the 8.3 ounces had me smacking my lips trying to make it last longer.  A natural sweetness and ice cold out of my refrigerator was the way I tasted it the first (and sadly only) time.<br /><br />I just wish a grocer in West Virginia would start carrying it. C\\'mon Wal-Mart and/or Food Lion.  Get some of this stuff! Having never made wine before, we decided to give it a try, mainly because of the price of this kit. Once we purchased the wine-making equipment (fermenter, carboy, siphons, air locks, hydrometer, etc) from a home-brew supply company, we were ready to make this wine. We used Midwest Homebrewing and Winemaking Supply ([...]) for the equipment package. They have a starter kit that is reasonably priced. I would also recommend purchasing a wine thief (to take samples with) and a container to hold your samples in when testing them, in addition to an auto siphon and maybe some oak chips for this kit. All in all, we spent about $60 on the equipment we needed to use this wine kit.<br /><br />Having read reviews about this wine-kit company\\'s wines being \"watery\" I decided to make 5 gallons instead of 6. Later, I read that this can be VERY tricky with kits because they are specifically tailored for that particular volume of wine. Maybe I got lucky, but our batch came out pretty good. I also added some extra tannin, a little citric acid and I soaked some oak chips in it during the final phase. I was careful to keep everything sterile (with the sterilizer that came with my equipment package- never use bleach or other household chemicals on wine equipment) and I also paid attention to the fermentation temperature, having read that two of the most important things in home winemaking are sterilization and temperature.<br /><br />I just bottled 23 bottles of this wine a couple of days ago and we drank the 1/2 bottle that was left over. It tastes like an inexpensive table wine you\\'d get in a restaurant in Italy or France. Nothing special, so far. However, I\\'ve read that even a few months of aging in the bottle can do wonders for these kit wines so I\\'m eager to see how it tastes later this year. As of bottling it was clear (no haze) and had a nice, light raspberry color to it. It was semi-dry with lots of fruit undertones; decent legs and an okay nose. There was a faint hint of oak, probably from the chips, which soaked in the carboy for about 5 days before bottling.<br /><br />All-in-all, I\\'ve paid more for wine that wasn\\'t as good. I\\'ve already started my second batch (a Vinter\\'s Reserve kit purchased locally) and today I started a small batch made from organic grape juice purchased at the grocery store (we\\'ll see what happens there).<br /><br />Warning, wine making can become addictive- it\\'s one part science, one part art. I\\'d recommend this kit to a beginner who doesn\\'t want to invest the $100 in  a higher-end kit. Good luck! I\\'ve used dried mushrooms many times over the years and these are among the best.  Though expensive the morel has great flavor and is easily reconstituted.  Already I\\'ve used them in a mushroom risotto and my favorite Fettuccine Alfredo.  The 4-ounce package has a volume of about five cups of the dried morels so it easily beats what I find in the local supermarket. Found this item and was thrilled.  This candy was a holiday favorite for years at my parent\\'s home, but has not been available for some time.  I\\'m so very pleased with the quality of this candy.  Just as we remember! Its a nice wind down at night.  Taste takes some getting used to but not too bad.  Sweeten with a litte honey.  The health benefits make up for the taste.  The product arrived as reported. Jolt-wise, this is a nice, gentle introduction to Extra Bold. (Darker roast, therefore less caffeine than most XB\\'s.) The taste is charcoal, with charcoal notes and a charcoal finish.  I have a sweet tooth and tend to prefer the sweeter, smoother coffees.  However, I occasionally have a Double Black Diamond because it wakes me up without making me jittery. One of my dogs has several food allergies. It\\'s a challenge to find a good and healthy product for him that does not contain something he is allergic to. This was one of the recommendations suggested by the place that did his allergy testing. I had my dogs on several different diets prior to trying this one, as well as frozen raw diet. I am very pleased with it, and my dogs like it! I highly recommend it as a healthy and good tasting product! This is an excellent pasta and I congratulate the monks, or at least those who occupy the Monesterio or bought its name. The curl in the pasta is perfect to capture the sauces mixed with the pasta. Since we live in the heat and here in Miami, we found it went well with a family recipe of shrimp, tomato, garlic, and hot spices. The price was reasonable and the quantity shipped makes it easy to part with one bag as a gift. Instead of bringing the traditional bottle of wine that never gets consumed and the host saves for his own enjoyment later, a pasta gift like this one has the same effect -- a follow up thanks by the host when it is you who should be saying \"thank you.\" Those of you who love black licorice or anise flavor - this is it! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic, it\\'s intense. In my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary! Good for your daily diet but remember this is not a wimpy tea, it\\'s full bodied. And great for your digestive system. Love, Love, Love this tea :) I\\'ve owned five German Shepherds, one Dalmation, and one mixed breed dog over a 15 plus yr. period. The Redbarn product is far superior in quality. Not one dog has disliked the product. The plus is that you don\\'t have to refrigerate the Red Barn roll until it is opened. Also, the portions of food you use from the roll can be adjusted by you in the event your budget is a little tighter at certain times of the month. I put slices of the food on top of a good quality dry dog kibble when I need to stretch my money.  I like the variety in sizes of the rolls as well as varied content of each roll.  Finally, many sources are embracing this product, and I am glad this site sells it at the most reasonable prices I have seen.  LORI, Phila. Chicken by-product meal, is crap and if you feed your dog this you don\\'t care about your dog.Upgrade to the Lamb and Rice Naturals from the same company, Or Chicken and Rice. They are 4 star rated by DOGFOODADVISORS.COM This tea is ok but it\\'s not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago. I was really reluctant to give these treats to my cat. It\\'s really important to me that she eats a very healthy diet, and while I\\'m not doing the raw food diet, I do scrutinize labels for meat by-products, BHA, and useless fillers. With that said, my cat couldn\\'t care less for those \"healthy\" treats that had passed my inspection. I have a cupboard full of treats I felt comfortable giving her that she ended up saving so she could play with them later. So, out of desperation, I bought these; a treat is, after all, a treat. And she goes berserk over them. She\\'s runs to the kitchen whenever I simply open a cupboard, hoping I\\'m about to give her one of her precious treats. I\\'ve also finally taught her to Come on command! And, to be honest, other treats (including this brand\\'s regular treats) have a lot worse ingredients. Dirty Martinis are my favorite drink. I used to just add the juice from a bottle of olives into my martini but I would go through the juice faster than the olives and my fridge was holding multiple \"juiceless\" bottles of olives. When I found this product I thought it was too good to be true - pure olive juice with no olives?? Then I saw the price so I had to jump on the deal.  Saucy Mama\\'s olive juice is delicious and potent! I use about half of the amount of juice I normally would use from a bottle of olives, making the product last a long time. I have given a few bottles away to dirty martini lovers and have gone through quite a few at home and even almost a year after my purchase I still have a few bottles left to use. This item is definitely worth the price and is a quality product - why pay more?? I tried this in sips to start after pouring it from the can and being surprised by the dark color.  It\\'s a proper espresso but it\\'s sweet and a bit bitter at the same time because it\\'s basically just espresso and sugar for some sweetness.  I have to say it is not my favorite but I was able to drink it.  Not sure I\\'ll be switching from my regular choice which has cream added, but to try this was not bad.  Probably ideal for people other than me who like their coffee strong and black with a hint of sweet since the flavors are definitely bold. This is a great drink and is a shame it has been discontinued by Nestles.  I have always enjoyed the taste and it is always refreshing to drink. I have sampled sooo many different K-Cups and this is by far my favorite!  If you enjoy a strong, yet smooth cup of java without bitterness, give it a try!!! This mix makes the most excellent cupcakes/cakes, you would never know it was gluten free.  It\\'s very easy to make but one strange thing happens when you are beating it. The batter seems to climb up the beaters, but it doesn\\'t matter, the end product is a wonderful treat for people who can\\'t eat gluten-typically cake mixes are very dry, however, this one seems to be perfect!  My hats off to Bob\\'s Red Mill Gluten Free Vanilla Cake Mix!!! The first time we ordered this it was so good. This time old and hard as a rock. We use it in a trade show so now left up in the air........Thankfully Amazon has such a good return policy. Tastes very good, and helps in healing my upset stomach and heart burns.<br />I going back for more...for sure.<br />They are lucky Down-Under. I was surprised to see that this product actually works, but they don\\'t warn you about the god-awful smell. It\\'s horrid, truly. We gave these to our labs on Christmas morning.  Within half an hour, one of the balls was falling apart - the dogs were able to bite chunks of the blue material off.  While the treat discs lasted a little while, the ball was not worth the money... definitely not \"everlasting\" nor \"virtually indestructible\".  Very dissapointed. I purchased this product because I wanted a powdered full fat cream substitute for baking and cooking on my low carb diet  ( full fat cream has zero carbs). However, when the product arrived, it was DRY WHOLE MILK which has 8 grams of carbs per 3 tbsp!  It has a decent taste and arrived as promised, but I would have never purchased dry whole milk... The product title is misleading..... Takes a lot of self control not to order another box. Love having these around for Christmas. Got a great price, product arrived promptly and they were fresh. A heck of a lot cheaper than buying locally. When I bought these treats for my dog I was hoping for, as most people are, an easy and mess free way to give my dog his/her Kong toy. That is exactly what I got.. kind of.<br /><br />Yes, my dog does love the taste of these treats, and they fit well inside my large Kong. The problem is that the treat either ends up stuck inside the Kong, inaccessible to the dog, or the dog pulls the entire treat out at once and eats it.<br /><br />I\\'m not totally satisfied with this product. It keeps my dog entertained for a little while but this treat doesn\\'t fully work as intended. I will not buy this product again. Thank you CIRCUIT TWEAKER! I really needed a laugh and your review brought me out of a funk. I found this item (43 oz NOT the 51 oz as stated in Product Features) for $6.00!!!! at a local Grocery Outlet store. I order the plum bonsai tree and it was packed good the tree came happy and is growing beautiful I\\'m very satisfied I will buy more bonsai trees from this company. The coffee is tasty, true and exactily like the San Francisco Bay coffee that you buy by the whole bean(and grind).  Rich flavor not acidic just TRUE I really want to buy this because I can\\'t find it anywhere. It\\'s been my favorite since the early 1970\\'s. That\\'s all I ate as a kid. But why on earth is this selling for $93.00 for 4 boxes of cereal on Amazon? That\\'s ridiculous. When I bought this popcorn, it was because Amazon recommended it or at least showed it with the air popper. As other reviewers have said, this popcorn does not work in the air popper. It hasn\\'t got enough weight  to stay in the popper long enough to pop. That same quality - lightness - is actually what makes it good popcorn otherwise. I recommend it for stove top popping in a deep saucepan with a lid. I discovered ginger chews when I was pregnant with my son a few years ago.  What a God send!  My co-worker bought me a few ginger items that I could not tolerate and then she brought me the ginger chews.  The first couple of months I was extremely nauscious and nothing helped until I ate these!  I have continued to find them every once in a while at Marshall\\'s and I keep them in my desk at work and at home just incase I get an upset stomach.  They definitely have a spicy kick to them, but I think they are the easiest to get down if you are not a ginger lover.  Get them!! I\\'m all for trying out alternative noodle products that aren\\'t made out of wheat.  So this brown rice vermicelli seemed to be right up my alley.  It boasted all natural ingredients, gluten free, fat free, and cholesterol free attributes, so it was a healthy option too.  And the fact that there is only three ingredients in the product is a huge plus too.  The package says it only contains Brown Rice, Sago Starch, and water.  Pretty simple, and I like that.<br /><br />The package it came in was pretty attractive, I do have to say.  A nicely designed bag with some marvelous looking food on the front and it clearly stated what was in the package.  There was a clear window in the back where you could see the actual product as well, so you\\'re not buying blindly.  And they even included two simple recipes on the back along with the nutritional information.  What surprised me most was just how thin this vermicelli was.  Very tiny noodles and they were looped together like a giant thing of thread.  And thread size is actually a good comparison for it.  It was colored a very pale brown, which accounts for being made out of brown rice.<br /><br />Cooking was easy enough.  I tossed it into a pot of boiled water and within minutes it was done.  But due to the very thin nature of the noodle I would advise watching it carefully or you could end up with a goopy mess if it overcooks.  The taste was good, a bit plain but it carried the sauce I made (a cheese base) well and let the sauce shine through instead of the noodle.  It was very soft to bite into, but as said before about the over cooking, that was probably a result of my skills and not the actual product.<br /><br />I would probably get these noodles again.  I like that they have few ingredients and are healthy, and I can have some gluten intolerant people over for dinner.  Not a bad deal all around.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012 This product was originally recommended by my Vet for my two shelties.  It\\'s a fantastic treat, they love it and its a great way to clean their teeth. I highly recommend this product. I have been a long-time drinker of the Original Sweet and Spicey tea and was glad to find it in an organic version.  Since kicking the caffeine habit a few years ago, I have been drinking this tea every morning, and I really look forward to it.  But, this version is so much weaker than the original version that it just tastes yucky to me.  I understand that the original version now contains an \"artificial\" ingredient to pump up the taste.  Whatever it is, I\\'m ok with it because the original version is so much better than this organic version.  It\\'s not worth drinking it if you don\\'t enjoy it.  (If this is the version of the tea you start with, this may be fine for you.  But if you are used to the more flavorful version, you won\\'t like this one.) These are fantastic crackers!  Kashi makes a great product in general and these crackers are no exception.  Very cheesy tasting without being overly salted.  The only downside was that this case appears to have been hit by a truck.  We\\'re about halfway through the case and each box has had more broken crackers than whole ones.  Still taste good, but it would be nice to have a box that didn\\'t look like it came from the bottom of the barrel. I would have preferred an expiration date a bit farther along than five months from now, considering I\\'m buying six jars. In the future, I\\'m going to wait until I find the stuff on sale at the local store and just buy it there. TASTE/ENJOYMENT<br />This is a beautiful espresso bean, full and creamy with an easy after-taste. As can be expected with 100% arabica beans, there is an earthy taste with notes of cocoa. This is perfect as a desert coffee, and I would highly suggest pairing it with a chocolate cake or pastry for maximum enjoyment. It does not work well as a breakfast coffee if you are looking for a jolt - it has reduced caffeine levels when compared to other espresso beans, but on the positive side it will make a great evening cup!<br /><br />CREMA<br />The crema that results from this blend is one of the best I have seen, sitting around long enough for you to enjoy your espresso without it spoiling. If you don\\'t understand why crema is important, I would strongly suggest doing a little research. If after doing some research you don\\'t think it\\'s important, then I would suggest picking up some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G2F5R4\">Folgers</a>.<br /><br />NOTE: To anyone who has never enjoyed European coffee:<br />Espresso beans are not supposed to be burnt, oily and dark in color. This is a by-product of poor espresso roasting, and has become the norm in the U.S. (think Starbucks). Espresso beans in most of Europe are a medium brown, without any oil on the surface (it stays within the bean with superior roasting processes). Espresso is not supposed to be diluted with syrups and flavored creamers, but should be consumed either straight from the machine, or in a macchiato or cappucino. You WILL notice a difference between this and Americanized coffee, and if you are expected something akin to Starbucks extra bold dark (overly) roasted beans, you will be disappointed. Instead, try to allow yourself to experience something different, the way that espresso was meant to be enjoyed. I agree with the previous reviewer in that the soup doesn\\'t have as much chicken as you would think by looking at the label, but I really like it. It has a nice mild flavor, and the rice is great. This Quaker oatmeal has the best flavor.  It is so convenient to just add hot water or warm in the microwave.  Perfect for breakfast when you are in a hurry, or even when you\\'re not and want a really flavorful hot cereal. We LOVE these mangoes!!  They are a great, healthy snack.  The price is a bit steep when you count in shipping costs, so we only buy as a treat every now and then.  But a great product, super yummy and super healthy!! I have used this for YEARS, and when my local stores weren\\'t carrying it, I found it through Amazon.  Such a great product when making anything requiring buttermilk - especially our morning buttermilk pancakes.  This takes a load off having to buy and store liquid buttermilk - which does not have a long shelf life.  I keep this in the refrigerator after opening, and always have buttermilk when I need it. The Vanilla is a nice change from the mocha because you can add ANY flavoring to it and make it whatever you like flavor-wise.  I like to mix 1:1 on the mocha and vanilla myself with some soy milk and ice, blended.  YUM YUM YUM.  My husband hates protein drinks and he gives two thumbs up to this product.  We drink it daily! Try it you won\\'t be sorry, promise! Let it be said that I am one who absolutely LOVES my coffee, perhaps a little too much, because for awhile I was drinking about a whole pot (!) a day by myself.<br /><br />It was when I got a stomach ulcer though that I was forced by my doctor to severely cut down on my intake of coffee permanently.  I still enjoy 2-3 small cups a day but no more.<br /><br />Thank heavens Lipton Decaffeinated Green Tea was there to come to the rescue in my case for the desire to drink more beyond that.  I am a huge music fan and am usually listening to my vast CD collection when not at work and seem to always want a hot, soothing beverage to sip to pass the hours by as I listen.  Lipton Green Tea is great for that.  It\\'s extremely easy to make, good for you, naturally decaffeinated and has that clean, pure taste that all Lipton tea has come to be known for.  I think I\\'m hooked for life on buying the 40-packet boxes at my local store and highly recommend it to those like me wishing to cut down on or even completely eliminate their daily dose of traditional caffeinated coffee. ordered a 5 pack and received a 4.5 pack. one pack had only one sleeve/box of t-discs. i took pictures and sent to amazon... but received no response. they got their cut of the sale so why should they care... . the coffee had a rich and bold flavor. i think it is a good value (so long as the quantity is correct). i will definitely buy this 5 pack again. I\\'ve been on a low carb diet and bought these.  I wouldn\\'t recommend them.  They aren\\'t bad tasting especially if your craving chocolate/peanut butter.  I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one.  I have tried Atkin\\'s products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs.  I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger.  In my opinion the Atkins taste 100 times better then the think thin bars.<br /><br />The Think Thin bars have 10 extra carbs then an Atkins bar.  They claim to be only 3 net carbs online but I think this is a lie. Sooooo disappointing. The coffee smells great but what emerges from the coffeemaker is what my mother used to refer to as \"dishwater.\" In fact, that\\'s actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for \"this side down\" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin\\'s regular taste like a gourmet blend. I, myself always enjoyed this movie, it\\'s very funny and entertaining, so I didn\\'t hesitate to pick up the clamshell edition.  I guess it was a marketing plan to make the movie more for families or something, but they  have eliminated all strong profanity and elements that are usually edited  in the television version.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  If you want the uncut  version, AVOID THE CLAMSHELL EDITION! This is a good idea in theory, especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like these, they didn\\'t taste like food - hard to describe, but the \\'primal\\' branding doesn\\'t help as I did feel like I was eating something I wasn\\'t supposed to.<br /><br />While the first one I tried was novel, I easily tired of them and then plain got grossed out by them. I won\\'t be getting these again. Having previously volunteered at a local food bank I am familiar with slightly-dented manufacturer donated cans.<br /><br />All 12 of the cans received had slight denting. This bag of dog treats is pretty much worthless. The \"buffalo bites\" are soo freeze-dried that they are literally feather-weight, mostly air, and that has the consistency of packing peanuts. These treats aren\\'t even crunchy for my dog to indulge in and enjoy. I will not be buying another one of these tiny bags filled with buffalo air bites. i used this product on my face along with alba papaya facial mask and it cleared my acne amazingly!! i was so pleased with this product its gental and smells fantastic and i recamend this product to women and men !! These are wonderful! They make a great snack. Like raisins, with a punch! But the real amazement happens when you cook with them. They turn in to something like pie cherries! I don\\'t know if I\\'ll have the nerve to try making a whole cherry dessert with these, but I think it could be done. In fact, I may have just inspired myself to try it. These are great, no matter what you do with them! This is an o.k. product for wet food for my Chihuahuas & I love the size & price.  The subscription process gives me a lower price & I don\\'t worry about running out.  My dogs are now on a really good dry food for small dogs but the almost 2 years I used this wet one, I was happy. I\\'m not a big coffee drinker and it\\'s hard for me to brew a perfect cup each time, but with Folgers Singles EVERY cup is perfect. It tastes better than brewed and is easy and convenient to use. Title says it all.  Coffee is great.  However, for some reason after making coffee, the press becomes nearly impossible to unscrew.  I\\'ve had to resort to pliers a number of times. The diet cola and diet lemon lime are great to me, but, sadly, I don\\'t like the diet orange. I dearly love having the equivalent of so much weight (regular bottles and cans) in such a small bottle. I\\'m slowly trying the rest of the diet flavors and hope to find more I like. I ordered this powder after having it at a coffee shop. It is sugar-free, but at 50 calories per 1.5 TBL, not calorie-free. Moreover, when I ordered my cold chai tea latte, the server used 1/4 cup of powder (120 calories) to get the true flavor. She used a blender with chipped ice and it was smooth; at home, when I tried to use it in hot chai (as shown on box), it clumped up and wouldn\\'t mix in. So, while it is tasty, it takes more than the container suggests to get real flavor from it and it is difficult to mix in a hot beverage. Given its price, I am disappointed. \"We repackage k-cups into a new bag. We use a recyclable and compostable bag that is eco-friendly.\"  So how would they \"gift wrap\" the crumpled and stapled brown paper bag in which these arrived?  I bought these as a gift, expecting a box or company gift bag as the eco friendly container. Mediocre collection of coffees that could have found while dumpster diving.  That\\'s what the presentation leads one to imagine.  Will not be giving as a gift and probably won\\'t use them.  Go to a local market instead! My dog was on this food for a while because i like many other people thought the veggies on the bag meant it was healthy but what it really means is their is no substance just corn and wheat gluten and dyes to color the food to make it look like vegetables. Please take it from me, my dog was chewing holes in his skin because of this food,i spent $700 at the vet for anti-histimine shots and creams and visits only to find out from my groomer that it was the food i was giving her. She was allergic to the dyes in it. I started giving her California naturals and she looked like she gained 3 years of her life back. Shiny coat, healthy glassy eyes, good energy and happier than she had been in a while. She is 14 now and i will never buy her anything but wonderful food like Nutro, California naturals, Merritt. I love the true lemon packets. I love lemon with my water and now I dont need to try and fit a lemon in my waterbottle, I can just dump the packet in! Amazing! Since I ordered 6 before trying them first I have been offering them to her periodically and she is never into them. Honestly I do not blame her, they are pretty gross. Diet coke tasted like carbonation only. Was not able to get a refund from vendor. Diet coke tasted like carbonation only. Was not able to get a refund from vendor. Check the price in your local stores. This is a good value. I always have sliced olives in my pantry for there is such a wide varity of uses. Some brands tend to be a little mushy but this one is always crisp and fresh. By buying by the case lot I do not have to worry about running out since I am 10 miles from the nearest grocery store. Arctic Zero Maple Vanilla is my absolute favorite flavors - It is rich tasting and creamy. The texture and flavor is wonderful!<br />This is great with salsa or other dips - or just by themselves.<br />Lower in sodium than the average tortilla chip and gluten free.  Amazon\\'s bulk price is the best! :) I bought a small buster cube for my 15lb furry mutt and he had a great time....until the inner cylinder popped off and the bottom half of his mouth got stuck in the hole. I was able to pry it off after he stopped yelping but it\\'d cut up his lip quite a bit. Oh, and this was his first time playing with the toy. My dog loves Booda Bones.  They are a bit pricy so I only give him a couple a week as a special treat.  I\\'ll continue buying them from Amazon for the best price. I treat my animal\\'s health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I\\'ve had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn\\'t have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she\\'s had to be taken to the vet\\'s for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she\\'s getting to be an old girl, she\\'s amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she\\'s getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She\\'s getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn\\'t resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.  My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground Yellow Corn, Oatmeal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Pork Meal, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Beet Pulp, Anchovy & Sardine Meal, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Wheat Germ Meal, Potassium Chloride, Carrots, Peas, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Dried Kelp, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.)  26%<br /><br />Crude Fat (min.)  12%<br /><br />Crude Fiber (max.)  3.00%<br /><br />Moisture  (max.)  10.00%<br /><br />Calcium (min.)  1.00%<br /><br />Phosphorus (min.)  0.080%<br /><br />Vitamin A  (min.)  22,000 IU/kg<br /><br />Vitamin E  (min.)  165 IU/kg<br /><br />Ascorbic Acid (min.)  30 mg/kg<br />(Vitamin C)*<br /><br />Omega 6 Fatty (min.)  2.40%<br />Acids *<br /><br />Omega 3 Fatty (min.)  0.60%<br />Acids*<br /><br />Glucosamine  (min.)  340 mg/kg<br />Hydrochloride<br /><br />Total Lactic Acid  (min.)  100,000,000<br />Microrganisms*<br /><br />(Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium in equal amounts)<br />*Not recognized as an essential nutrient by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles<br />Eagle Pack Senior Adult Dog Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance.<br /><br />FEEDING GUIDELINES (from the website):<br /><br />Transitioning to Eagle Pack®<br />It is important to slowly transition your dog from his/her current diet as it takes a few days for the body to adapt to the new nutrient levels.

Just tried for the first time at whole foods and this by far has the best taste of any coconut water We\\'d been looking for organic miso and couldn\\'t find it at local stores; glad we found this at Amazon; easy purchase and it\\'s delicious.  Easy to prepare, be sure not to over heat because that kills it.  Enjoy! The instructions are so simple, and the amount to use so small.It will last a long time. Absolutely delicious. Perfect balance between the peach flavor and the flavor of the black tea.<br /><br />As Hurricane Irene approached my home and the surrounding trees, I decided to wait it out in a motel. St. Dalfour Peach was the only tea I packed.<br /><br />What more can I say? Kosher. High quality no-added-sugar excellent chocolate powder. The aluminum cans it comes in are liable not to hold up to mailing all that well, but there\\'s also a plastic bag around them, so it\\'s not a huge deal straightening it all out after arrival. The powder is gourmet, really delicious & goes a long way, and has a unique malty chocolate flavor that 99% of chocolate lovers should love. Pricey, yes, but if this is for you, IT IS REALLY A TREAT. (I use it as a secondary flavor additive 1/2 & 1/2 with cheaper \"Frappaccino\" mixes for blended coffee drinks at home, and it is indespensable. Only minus one star- for \"pricey\". My dog is a very picky eater, but I thought I would give these treats a try and he loves them. He\\'s a tiny five pound Chorkie so they are a perfect size for him and even if you had a bigger dog they\\'d be great for training. These are my favorite chips.  Very crunchy and tasty.  Not processed and mealy like other baked chips.  You\\'d never know you were eating a reduced fat product.  The best!!! This trap has been so effective that it has almost taken the challenge out of trapping moles in my yard.  I had tried other types of traps and was disappointed with the results. I\\'ve put my other experiences at the end if you are interested.<br /><br />As with any trap, it must be set in an active tunnel and it took a couple attempts to learn to set the Out O Sight.  However, once learned and active tunnels found, I have a 100% tripped trap/dead mole ratio.  As several others have said, following the directions sets the trap too deep.  On the other hand, the method described in other reviews here was too shallow to work for me.<br /><br />I have a recently re-graded yard with new topsoil trucked in so the soil is still fairly loose.  The top of most of the mole tunnels are about 3-4\" deep.  Pushing the tunnel down and setting the trap on top without digging down proved too shallow.<br /><br />The technique that has worked for me is similar to that on the box, but not quite as deep as described.  Carefully excavate a section of the tunnel as wide as the trap and as deep as the bottom of the tunnel without disrupting the structure of the bottom half of the tunnel ... the bottom half of the walls and the floor.  Then take a few clumps of the dirt (it has been very wet here since starting to trap) and put them in the tunnel between where the claws of the trap will go.  Don\\'t pack it tight, just drop them in.  Set the trap with the claws slightly deeper than the bottom of the tunnel by pressing it in.  The trip pan should sit on the clumps you put in.  Put the remainder of the soil back around the tunnel opening you made and around the trap to block out the light.  Do your best not to disrupt the tunnel leading up to the trap\\'s jaws and don\\'t pack it too tighly.  You want the mole to be in the jaws before encountering blockage.<br /><br />I have been holding the trip pan down while pushing the trap to the desired depth so I don\\'t accidentally set it off and then making sure the release side of the trip pan is not tight against the soil which would possibly prevent it from springing.<br /><br />Since starting in November, the count is 10 with 3 of them in the last week.  Most of the time I have my quarry within 12 hours of setting the trap .  The time it will take is directly dependent on finding an actively used tunnel.  I patrol my yard almost every day and get the trap in immediately after finding a new tunnel.<br /><br />I have docked the device one star because the jaw of one of the first two traps I bought inexplicably cracked.  Also because I think it could be easier to set, but practice makes perfect. (use caution)  Despite this, the trap has been so effective and much less expensive than the alternatives that I have purchased 3 additional traps to replace the broken one and the other traps I have purchased that were not effective.<br /><br /> Plunging spear type:  Anchoring seemed to be an issue as well as spring strength to reach the mole in the heavy clay soil here.  The trap would be tripped, but no mole under it.<br /> Trapline in-tunnel wire trap:  A device that is genius in its simplicity and would likely do well in dryer soil than I was trying to trap in.  My experience was the moles digging around the device.  Perhaps I just didn\\'t master setting it.  I also didn\\'t like having to dig up the trap to see if it was tripped.<br /> Poison pellets:  Not sure if the moles took them or not.  Worked too slowly to stop the damage, so a worthless approach in my mind. I buy mine at my local Trader Joe\\'s.  It doesn\\'t have that great a taste.  I prefer fruity teas or rooibos teas.  But it has its great uses.  Just like rooibos teas is a healthy herbal tea, yerba mate really heals me in times of heavy stress.  I hoard my batch of yerba mate tea in times of heavy stress and it works like clockwork. I\\'ve enjoyed the versatility of this green tea.  It works well, hot, cold, sweetened and unsweetened.  The green tea part isn\\'t too bitter and the flavor is strong enough to be considered a bit more than mild.  It is a wonderful iced tea, sweetened with stevia...yumm. Fragrance: EXTREMELY strong, synthetic smelling fragrance.  I used the product once to give a fair review and the scent made me ill.  If you aren\\'t sensitive to strong and/or synthetic scents it\\'s probably going to just smell like shampoo to you.<br /><br />Cleaning:  Cleaned hair very well, lathered richly, rinsed easily.<br /><br />Conditioning:  I normally use a conditioner but did not need to after using this shampoo.  Huge bonus points for that.<br /><br />Safe for color treated hair:  The product contains sodium laureth sulfate which is considered to be easier on colored hair than many of the other sulfates.  In an ideal world there would be an affordable, sulfate-free, effective shampoo--but we don\\'t live in that world--yet.<br /><br />Overall:  This is a good product but I will continue my search for a color safe shampoo that has no sulfates and actually cleans your hair and leaves it in a somewhat manageable condition. This is an AWESOME condiment.  I use it all the time on every kind of meat.  It really give a smoky flavor to the food without the fuss of an actual barbecue.  I highly recommend it. This is the best snack of its kind that I\\'ve ever tried (and I\\'ve tried many!)  The wasabi has a little kick to it, but not enough to slow down the copious amounts of the snack that I find myself devouring in one sitting.  And the sweet cranberries are a great little treat in every bite.  There is a little bit of peanut dust and paper shells at the bottom of each bag which can be messy, but if you like a snack with a little \\'bite\\' to it, this is your treat. I\\'m not a huge flavored coffee fan. Usually I prefer lattes with flavored syrups. A friend sent me a K-Cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing. The flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk; I added a little vanilla syrup when I reheated it. I am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there. It is just a unique taste for when you\\'re in the mood for something different! I sent them as a gift so I didn\\'t get to taste them myself but the recipient was very happy with them. BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you\\'ll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal. I agree with the previous review. These six cans should cost no more than $40 together, so surely this is a mistake. I have not yet bought it from amazon but found it at my local gas station and picked up a box to try it. I am pregnant and cereal is all I have really craved mostly fruit loops. This cereal is great I told my husband If amazon still has it come this week I am ordering it. I love the little marshmellows. I think it\\'s the best invention ever since I am not to big on lucky charms but buy them for the marshmellows. Great cereal would recamend it. (sorry for the spelling) The sweetener used in this over powers the flavor.  It has a decent aroma but the closest approximation of taste I could give it is hot apple juice with extra sugar.  It may appeal to someone that likes very sweet drinks without the calories.  I enjoyed <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AWTR6M\">Green Mountain Naturals Hot Apple Cider</a> and was hoping this would be a caramel flavored, less calorie laden, version but was sorely disappointed. I\\'m one of those lucky individuals allergic to everything under the sun, so I\\'m hard-pressed to find a cruchy, salty, food-safe snack. These are one of my favorites, namely because most plantain chips are coated with sweet-this product is not sweet. I give this product a 5 star rating, however, I can\\'t understand why they are charging so much for them. The in-store price $1.69 per 6oz. package. If you order them from this website, they would amount to $4.41 per 6oz. package-and that doesn\\'t include the S/H they charge!  Find someone who lives near a Trader Joes to pick some up for you and ship it for waaaay cheaper. My heritage is Hungarian so I had to try this product.  This is the best honey I have ever tasted.  It is delicious and pure.  The honey pump is amazing.  There is no sticky mess and so clean to use.  I highly recommend the seller Curlymom.  I placed my order and received it in three days.  Great service. This is great cat food. I recommend it highly. The only flavor I do not use from the Instinct Canned products is the Chicken. All the others are a part of our rotational feedings and my cats LOVE it! My cats were addicted to an additive that is used by other commercial producers. Once we got past that problem we have not had any issues since... My cats are home, trim and healthy because of Nature\\'s Variety Instinct wet cat food. What a tasty and different treat this salt is!  I have been using it for about a year now and it is the only salt I use for grilling and cooking.  This salt is much stronger than normal salt so you have to take care at first not to overdo things.<br /><br />When used in grilling, I use it as part of my rubs.  The course grains slowly dissolve as the meat or vegetables are cooking, giving the dish a dice even salt spread.  It works so much better.  I use to use only Kosher salt for these rubs but have more or less replaced  the Kosher with this product.<br /><br />I do not serve it on the table as it will indeed muck up a salt grinder.  The few times I have used it, I have ground it up in a ceramic mortar bowel and severe it in small salt cellars.<br /><br />This is a good product and I am glad I started using the stuff.  As far as I can tell, this is a pretty good price it is being offered at here. These are the 12 oz. cans, not the 24oz. cans that you would think they would be by the \"lowered\" price! Not the deal that you think you are getting!! I was skeptical about these brownies before ordering. I ordered one box just to give them a try. I normally eat pure protein bars and they are OK as far as taste goes, main purpose is the protein of course. I wanted an actual treat type food without actually eating junk food. I was blow away by the Glenny\\'s choc chip brownies. I only tried one so far but it exceeded my expectations and then some! Individual wrapped, in it\\'s own tray, it tasted fresh, did not taste \"healthy\" like one would expect. It tasted like what a regular brownie would taste like, less that overly sugary feeling. Being all natural with an amazing nutritional profile really make this brownie a winner. It really is guilt free, 100cals, 12g carbs, 4g fat, 4g protein - I am not complaining and it fit my daily macros very well. I will be ordering another box or two. When I first received this 5lb bag of candy from my friend for Christmas, I thought to myself how times have changed.  In the past I had always received a giant box of cherry sour ball candies.  When this bag showed up, I knew I had graduated to the next level.<br />Upon inspecting the bag I realized it did not contain a zipping closure, so this would become my responsibility.  Luckily for me an old bag of \"Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Granny Smith Apple Chips\" was safely in my file drawer.  I knew that it would come in handy one day.  After transferring the contents of this bag of \"Large Bite Crawlers\" from Trolli my first instinct was to share this with my co-workers.  This day in particular we had been pushing our manliness by eating raw habanero peppers to see which guy would cry first.  While these crawlers did not ease the pain in which we had inflicted upon ourselves, they did however bring a smile to our face.  In the end I realized these candies are what it\\'s all about, colorful worms wrapped in sugar... little bit sweet, little bit sour.<br />TLDR<br />These crawlers are great, especially when you\\'ve had habanero pepper man contest prior. There\\'s not a single thing wrong with this coffee. It leans more toward the darker, richer side but it\\'s not overpowering. Just buy it already. Flat coffee taste, artificial vanilla, blah.  Of all the pods I\\'ve tried in my Senseo, these are the worst. This is good oatmeal, takes a while to cook but well worth the effort. It has a lot fewer hulls than a couple other brands I have tried so you aren\\'t fishing them out of your bowl often.<br /><br />I\\'ve found that making a big pot and refrigerating it for later microwaving works really well. It keeps its firm texture and if anything tastes better. I do not eat potato chips very much anymore so I bought Popchips to see if it was a good product. After eating two bags and giving a few to friends/co-workers I think they are above average. My friends/co-workers liked them.<br />Still processed food but better for you than regular, oily potato chips. For what they are they work.<br />The price is OK. Maybe they are more expensive to make so not a big hit here. The taste of these drops is a good sweet licorice taste, however they\\'re a gummy texture which I\\'m not too fond of, they stick to your teeth. This is a good hot cocoa.  It is really good for someone who is looking for all the taste of hot cocoa but wants to limit their caffeine intake, it is 99% caffeine free.  Also it has some needed vitamins that many woman are looking for at different times in their life. I have grown to adore rooibos tea. Choice Organic\\'s version is more flavorful by FAR than others I\\'ve tried. The fact that it is produced organically is comforting. No nasty chemicals!<br /><br />FYI: Red bush tea (Rooibos) is quite different from black or green tea. Less tannins provide a very smooth mouth feel. Contains high level of antioxidants & flavonoids (cancer fighters). Free of caffeine. Used medicinally in Africa for centuries. Discovered by Europeans circa near 1772. Substantial health benefits with studies to back it up. Also nice for facial skin.<br /><br />Amazon\\'s price for the 6-pack is approx $8-9 less than others I found which makes mama a very happy shopper. I ordered Berry, but sounds like Amazon has a bit of product confusion because I received Raspberry instead.  I wasn\\'t even aware raspberry was sold, but the packaging images and SKU is different from Berry.  Although Amazon has refunded my money and assured me I can order again, I\\'m concerned the same thing is going to happen.  The Amazon sticker applied to the packaging says \"Berry\" even though it\\'s not.  They\\'ve got some serious product confusion here, and need to fix the page to reflect that. I\\'ve had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy\\'s Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It\\'s only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop \"regular\" but instead has \"Extra Bold\". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes. Having lived in Baltimore for years, I really enjoy traditional Maryland crabs.  The Old Bay seasonings in this packet allow me to enjoy that flavor but with less expensive canned tuna.  It\\'s quick and easy to make. YUM!  It\\'s also hard to find in the grocery stores for some reason so I was thrilled find this in amazon.com. My wife, who is from Bangkok, loves these noodles. Up until now, we have had to bring them back with us from Thailand. The sooner they are available, the better! Taste is OK. But too sweet and too much sugar may keep me away from this sauce. Also won\\'t recommend using it without cooking, since the oder seems raw. My wife and I have been drinking this coffee for over 8 years and find it to be the best of everything we\\'ve tried. As other reviewers have said, no mint bliss in this package.  That was the only reason I ordered what I thought the picture accurately depicted.  I wish I\\'d seen the other reviews first.  Going back nearly two years on the reviews, I guess no one is reading their feedback. Recently I made some homemade lip balm with a chocolate/orange/truffle scent, and since I use it all the time, the intense scent was driving me mad; I kept wanting to eat the lip balm.  So I came to Amazon to see what they might have to help me out with this problem, and ordered this product.  (I know Lindt is high quality; I used to eat it all the time when I was younger.)  Delish!  It is a perfect thing to nibble on when I\\'ve just put on the lip balm! The product is fine. The pricing is an issue. Ordered under subscribe and save for the time, the price was $6.43, great bargin. Checked on the next shipment, the price jumped to $12.23. Nearly doubled. I cancelled that subsciption. This isn\\'t gasoline for crying out loud. WATCH YOUR FUTURE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE ORDERS I have ordered the Salmon Sticks before and thought I would give the Duck and Chicken flavor a try!  My dogs love them!  What a great healthy treat for my dogs!  Highly recommend!  Will order again! We feel our 6 mo old takes this formula better than the powered ed version. not sure if her stomach gets upset with powder but this ready made formula is so much easier to package for daycare and off you go. if you go through formula quickly, get a case or two and you\\'ll be amazed how fast you go through it.<br />packaging of the containers is always solid. they use pretty thick card stock. sometimes the seal is a bit hard to get fully off, and you have a little clear plastic left on the top, if you dont remove it and try to pour the formula, you might make a small mess if you pour too slowly.... I ordered this tea for a change and, indeed, it is! The tea is much stronger and not as smooth as I am accustomed to drinking. It takes barely a few seconds to steep before turning bitterly strong. I like the concept of the triangle bags but they have torn and leaked out tea a few times. It is a bargain tea and good for those who enjoy a strong, robust flavor...just a little too much for my tastes. A trick I learned while living in Europe is that if you combine saccharine (which is what Necta Sweet is) with Equal or some other similar sweetener, the taste is a lot better than either one by itself.  The Germans sold sweeteners that were a combination, and they were remarkably better than what we had here.  You can get the same effect by combining a packet of equal with one of these tablets.  RJB. My cats look healthy when they eat this food, and it\\'s their favorite dry food. It\\'s high in protein and has adequate fat to keep their fur looking good. I am so glad Long Kwo recently added what appears to be two new products (Hot and Sour and Shoyu) to its line of Crystal Noodle soups. Still wish they were cheaper but I will continue to enjoy them for lunch.They are both quite tasty and make a nice addition to the already great line of products they\\'ve been offering on the US market. A pound of training treats at this price is a good deal. I like everything about the treats including the size. They are NOT too tiny for my Great Dane and I can use a lot of them without filling him up and expanding his waist.  He loves the flavor, the smell is strong enough to entice without being offensive. The peanut butter flavor has not upset his sensitive stomach. They arent messy on your hands or in your pockets. They will dry out if left outside the package for any length of time so I usually separate some into a small tupperware type container for home and into small ziploc bags for carrying to classes or on walks. I will sometimes put a handful in my pocket and these actually survive the washing machine (not sure if that is good or bad). I bought this granola, being a newly diagnosed celiac, desperate for something \\'clean\\' to eat. It was GREAT. Nice nutty taste, good cinnamon taste and crunchy. I would buy more - but I am making my own granola now. Definately worth buying. Always hard to find that right color of orange at Halloween.  Glad to find this product available.  But do remember the bottle size is small.  Good Product. Well, I was envious when I gave this my dog.  It really does smell good and he loves it. I am a fanatic about fabulous chocolate and even more so when it\\'s combined with orange. AND, boy oh boy, Chocolove has hit the nail on the head with this delicious chocolate bar! Well worth  the price. I would definitely recommend this chocolate...so fantastic! I agree with the person who said it\\'s hard to chew and here is why.<br /><br />Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair?<br /><br />It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess.<br /><br />Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make \"mechanically separated\" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste \"good\"? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100!<br /><br />My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog\\'s p..p<br /><br />EEWWW!!! My property is surrounded by tidal water and woods. Needless to say, there is an abundance of flying and biting critters. Cutter 53663 has proven [to me] to be a very good Repellent. Application is much more pleasurable than other repellents that I have used. My other two favorites (Avon & Bullfrog) contain sun-screen and I hate to waste them for short time period exposures to the bugs. It goes without saying that this repellent is deet free and has a nice but subtle odor. Overall this is a great repellent. This is the first treat I\\'ve gotten that says it is for both cats and dogs, so I was a little skeptical at first that my cat, Lily, would like it. She\\'s 15 years old and has become very finicky about what she eats. She now turns up her nose at our Purina dry food, which used to be her favorite. I\\'ve been feeding her cans of salmon and gravy (Fancy Feast) but even with that she leaves a lot of leftover salmon pieces in the bowl (!)<br /><br />Discouraged, I had nothing to lose and decided to give her half of a Raw Boost treat to see if she\\'d like it. The box says you should give your cat only one or 2 treats per 20lbs of the cat\\'s weight. Well, my Lily is a tiny cat and weighs only 5 lbs or so, so imagine my dilemma. Taking the treat out of the package, I was amused at how much the treat resembles a peanut butter cookie. It\\'s soft, however, and easy to tear in half. It feels crumby like a cookie, however, so I decided to break it down into little \"crumbs\" for Lily to eat. She has problems with digestion and throws up more than the typical cat, so I\\'m always careful to chop up her food into small, bite-sized pieces.<br /><br />Imagine my relief that Lily loves it! She licked her dish clean and begged for more. I\\'m going to make a note to buy more. There are wide selections of bottled drinking waters available.  This current trend of high pH water claims many \"healthful benefits including being a natural antioxidant, flushes out toxins and neutralizes acidity in the body, more hydrating than conventional water, etc.\" from online health and nutrition websites.  Let\\'s give this Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water a try.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>Decent taste; similar to my home water filter system with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YOQ0C2\">Watts Premier 531105 RO-Pure Annual Filter Pack</a> that also uses reverse osmosis purification.<br />>I drank the sample 1.5 liter bottle for two evenings during my after-work workouts and didn\\'t notice any improvements in performance but it did quench my thirst very well and seemed to have shortened recovery time with less sore muscles (perhaps from some lactic acid buffering properties AFTER the workouts).<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>I appreciate this sample but the cost of Approx. $5 for each 1.5 liter bottle is very high.  My Ro-Pure system filters the same amount of water for far less.<br />>Healthful benefits are only claims and not proven through scientific studies with proper clinical research methodologies.  It\\'s difficult to draw conclusions by just drinking 1.5 liters.<br />>Possible long term effects of high pH drinking water with ingredients of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride (salts/electrolytes).<br /><br />Overall:<br />Overpriced \"trendy\" drinking water that tastes about the same as home reverse osmosis filtered water.  Claims of high pH water health benefits questionable.  Works OK as regular drinking water but doesn\\'t improve performance during workouts. My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren\\'t super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them. This was recommended by my nutritionist as I have a lap band & do not need extra fat & calories.  It has a great taste & satisfies my craving for desserts late at night.  I also put this in my yogurt breakfast shake with a banana.  Great treat & highly digestible.  Love this chocolate flavor & the regular peanut butter flavor. Very satisfied with price & fast delivery from Amazon. This tastes HORRIBLE!!! COMPLETE waste of MONEY!!!<br />Contacted company to try to get a refund but no success. I like this product a lot.  It is the best coffee I\\'ve had, I think it\\'s as good as the coffee I get from freshly ground beans.  It\\'s so easy to use.  I tried both the original and mocha.  I liked the original a lot, but really like the hint of chocolate in the mocha. Favorable tea that I would recommend too anyone.  Excellent, good tasting tea.  Truely enjoy. Heard about the tea through an article written by Dr Oz. While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don\\'t like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn\\'t overpowering and the bar isn\\'t sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid\\'s candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription. this is one of our favorite snack foods. It is delicious, tasty, and satisfying. In the grocery stores around here, it sells for $3.99/bag. On Amazon, when buying this product in bulk, it saves us a lot more and we go through it like there\\'s no tomorrow. The Garlic and Parmesan is one of our favorite pita chips. It can get a bit heavy for some if one was to have a party. We\\'d go with the regular flavor Pita Chips and serve different dips.<br /><br />But for us, the garlic and parm do not need any help from any dips (thus saving us from those double/triple/quadriple dippers and finger lickers!!). Great on its own, great as a compliment to Italian soups These mints melt in your mouth and taste good with no aftertaste. Beware they are powdery so you can\\'t really carry the tins around in your purse or pocket. The mints are small so I\\'ve been popping 3 at a time. When visiting London a few years ago, our hotel had packets of this Cadbury Highlights Hot Chocolate Mix along with the usual coffee and tea.  Once I tried it, I was hooked!  As were both my sisters travelling with me!  It\\'s so creamy and chocolatety - AND ONLY 40 CALORIES!!!  Can you beat that?  I just wish it were easier to find here across the pond! Sweet tulsi taste with a hint of spicy ginger.  This is delicious tea at a nice price, especially being organic.  I make a pot with one teabag of this tea and one with Kalahari brand \"Zambezi\" rooibos chai (also purchased on amazon) and it is a refreshing non-caffeine combo.  I drink it every day! These are small bags, just the right size as a snack for my kindergartener.  They are not the size you find at stores so don\\'t be surprised when you receive them.  Also, they ship all 300 loosely thrown into a cardboard box so you\\'ll open the box and there they are...  Not neat at all, but that\\'s how they come.  My son loves these. Sour apple tastes toxic.  Yuck.  No wonder my kids wont eat it.  However, they love all the other flavors in the variety pack. Everyone loves Oreos. They\\'re even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son\\'s Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation. My dog loves the chews and they neither bare any noticeable odor<br />or leave any residue in the lovely home my wife keeps very clean.<br />On one occaison I received two bags that had razor cuts from the<br />warehouse, they were immediately replaced without any question.<br />Great product and superb customer service from the folks at Cadet<br />and IMS. My pack was very dry. The flavor was ok, pretty bland. Overall I would rate as a below average jerky. Wouldn\\'t buy again. These chips taste okay - although I probably would have liked the Nacho flavor better, they were 3 dollars more a case at the time I made my purchase. The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don\\'t believe it\\'s an isolated problem. This bar lived up to all my expectations. The mix of sweet and salty was just right and was the perfect<br />late afternoon pick me up you don\\'t have to feel guilty about. Will definitely order again. I have been trying to find a good brand of jerky that I don\\'t have to order online.  I finally tried Jack Link\\'s original.  Way too sweet, doesn\\'t taste like meat, and most of the pieces don\\'t have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn\\'t even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined... My cats do enjoy this food but the can is SO hard to open.  The flip tab thing is easy to pry up but it hurts my fingers to use the flip tab to actually pull the top off the can. I do have to pull them open 3 at a time, twice a day for my 3 cats though so maybe it\\'s just me. I wish it came in a pouch or something instead but some sort of packaging that was easily recycled. One of the best taste coffee so far. No bitter taste like other coffee have. Highly recommend for coffee lovers. I as well as most people on these reviews ate the cereal all the time as a child, and purchase it because of the memories and great taste it has.My Family and I now purchase this 4 pack once a week from this seller and it\\'s excellent. I\\'ve never had a problem with a package being damaged,the shipping\\'s fast, and the product tastes like it always has!! thank you!! I can\\'t even call this a product it is food real food \"Whole food\" and organic, my cats love this excellent food, and I feel safe feeding it to them.<br />Thank you Newmans Own! This will be a substitute for my favorite drink, Postum, but it doen\\'t have the mellow taste. My son works at a golf course and saw these bars in their pro shop...decided to give it a try!  WOW!  He was pleasantly surprised by not only the refreshing energy it gave him but how good it actually tasted (versus many other bars I have bought that he thought were disgusting)!  He not only works at a course, but is an avid golfer...high school team and the rest of the year, as often as he can!  I\\'m gonna try the 1st tee bars too since this one was such a hit! I have a Chinese Shar-Pei and he loves this! He\\'s highly allergic to corn, wheat, and soy it doesn\\'t have any of that.  What\\'s also great is unlike petfood stores that charge an arm and a leg to ship dog food Amazon doesn\\'t.  I hope they keep carrying this! I recently noticed that a neighborhood tom had started marking my front porch -- not exactly the kind of fragrance you want to welcome your guests.<br />One application of the Havahart granules in the planters he was spraying and he hasn\\'t been back, woohoo! On the negative side, it will get washed away so you need to reapply more often than every 30 days if the area gets irrigated or if it rains, so it can get quite expensive. But hey, it works! We normally don\\'t buy expensive treats (tend to stick to dry biscuits), but we got these for all of the family dogs as stocking stuffers for Christmas. They were a huge hit! Our dog is willing to do anything imaginable to get one of these. My boyfriend\\'s mom, who totally spoils her Portie, hadn\\'t seen these before, and her dog loved these like crazy as well, so she went out bought a bunch more when they ran out. Also, they\\'re natural and there are no shady ingredients, so they are good for your pooch!<br /><br />Just to clarify, these don\\'t actually have the consistency of jerky. They are little squares of what looks like pressed meat product. Clearly, our dogs do not care and consume these with great enthusiasm, so still very highly recommended! Beneful portrays itself as a healthy dog food full of meat and vegetables - of which it has some - but, unfortunately, two of the top three ingredients are corn products... ground yellow corn (#1) and corn gluten meal (#3). As with cows and humans, corn is not exactly the most nutritious \"vegetable\" (actually it is a grain) for a diet. Eaten in moderation, it is fine, but as a primary source of carbon molecules and proteins, it is not the easiest food source for our or our dogs\\' bodies to process.<br /><br />In addition to the corn products, the second ingredient is a meat by-product - not exactly the best protein source we envision when hear words like beef or chicken or meat... or see a picture of sliced muscle meat on the packaging. High quality dog food, I feed lamb as it is easier on their disgestion, I highly recommend this if you have small dogs.. I got this pod to try in my Senseo brewer because I LOVE french vanilla and couldn\\'t find any Senseo Paris french vanilla. This works great with my Senseo brewer and the quality of the coffee is way better too. I am so glad I thought to give this a try. Now I want to try all the pods available by this brand. I love this stuff, and was able to provide it to my sister when she came down with gestational diabetes. As a major sugar fan and chocoholic, she said this helped the craving a little, while not affecting her blood sugar at all. Fantastic!<br /><br />-1 star due to spendiness (but it\\'s not really cheaper at the stores, it\\'s just a spendy product) I have been a Kashi fan for the past few years and love the Heart to Heart and with the White Tea added, it is simply delightful! While I do like this product, there needs to be a better way of packaging these items to prevent broken caps. I had never had a macaroon before ordering these, and I will definitely be ordering specifically from LeilaLove again. Her customer service is fantastic, shipping is quick, packaging is beautiful & high quality, and the cookies are DELICIOUS!! I have been ordering these candy canes for months to help combat stomic issues and aid in quitting smoking too.  Very effective for both I stated.  Infact I shared some with my postal worker she confirmed it helped with her stomic.  Thanks will continue to order and share with others. These are crispy cookies, not soft. If you like your cookies that way, they are the best packages cookies I\\'ve ever had. My Boston Terrier LOVES Stella and Chewy\\'s.  We do feed her the frozen raw patties, but use these as a treat or for fast or on the go feeding.  She gobbles them up like they are a treat and begs for more!  It is hard not to feed her more than the recommended amount because she would eat more if given to her.  I love how they are so easy to take with us and no need for dishes or cleanup!  I also love that I save a couple bucks getting them here rather than at my local pet food shop. My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one. If you are sick of that malt flavour, as my kids and I are; then this Ovaltine is for you.  Where I live the only Ovaltine I can get is that old-fashioned, non-disolvable malty one - yuck - this new Ovaltine is great in cold milk or hot milk.  Simply delicious. A great alternative to just drinking water. Oolong or Wu-long is known for its medicinal properties but if this is medicine it\\'s the best tasting medicine on the planet. I found it at my local Asian grocery store, bought a case and then couldn\\'t find it anymore so thank you Amazon for providing a way to access it. I subscribed to get a case a month. I agree with the other reviewers about its taste, smooth and excellent when cold although I picked one up from my last case and drank it at room temperature and found it to be just as refreshing. The packaging is different in stores and the bottle looks like the Oi-ocha green tea from Ito-En but with a yellow/tan label. Happy drinking. My vet recommended these treats to help with my cats tartar build up. The treats come in a wrapper which I think is edible but I take it off. One cat LOVES these treats and the other won\\'t touch them. But...the AMZN price is so so much cheaper (about 1/3 the cost) than the vets price. I wouldn\\'t buy them anywhere but AMZN. This is a great rice, tender when cooked and sticky. But this $18.00 price for 5 lbs is way too expensive. I bought a 20 lb bag for 22.50 at the local Asian Market. Look around your town for a far more reasonable price. I have used this seasoning packet on duck, pork, but mainly for roast chicken, for years. I rub the dry mix all over a whole fryer chicken, stick it in the fridge overnight, and roast the next day in the oven or outside on the grill. Letting it \"marinate\" overnight gets the flavors all through the meat. Tasty and juicy, the way Chinese Roast chicken is supposed to be. The directions state to mix the seasoning with water, but I\\'ve found using it as a dry rub works best for me if I\\'m roasting. Definitely mix with water if putting it in the crock-pot. Delicate, slightly sweet Chinese five spice flavor. Would I recommend? Absolutely! I ordered triple chocolate crunch bars and received cookies and cream, which are too sweet.  I\\'ve been eating them, but I don\\'t like them. My little dogs love the Smokehouse Duck Tenders and they are a good weight conscious treat for them!  I\\'m glad Amazon usually has them in stock.  they are worth the price! I am not a rice connoisseur and the Roland Thai Jasmine Rice is the first type of Jasmine rice I have ever tasted. To me, this rice looks like Basmati rice (long and thin grains). It cooks pretty well (turns fluffy) and fast in the microwave. I add 2 cups of water for every cup of rice - and the cooked rice looks like cooked Basmati rice! The rice tastes good too although I have to say I prefer the taste of real Basmati Rice.<br /><br />[...] My dog got hooked on these pretty young, and now they\\'re the only \"treat\" he\\'ll eat. My mom had been giving them to her dog, and when he stayed over there he got a taste of them and went crazy. They seem to be relatively healthy, and we can make them last a long time. My dog is a wanderer, and the best way we\\'ve found to keep him close, is to give him a piece of one of these when we whistle and he comes home. Since we\\'ve gotten him trained, he always comes back to a whistle. He\\'s a small dog so we usually only give him about 1/3 of one of these, and one bag will last us a month. If you do the subscription plan with Amazon, the price ends up being very reasonable. Since recieving my brewer I have been buying all sorts of combo packs and experimenting looking for trhe best flavor for me and was excited to see the Folgers become available as I used to drip brew it, and liked it. Unfortunately I don\\'t, or haven\\'t yet, find the same flavor in the Keurig K Packs. Hmmmmmmm..... what changed? IS a great product .like I remember from my childhood.the ones my grandmother use to make.I would recomend these. If you don\\'t remember these it would still be great on hot Biscuits Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon). My friend loved the gift we send but she had no idea who got it for her. I was curious so I asked her and she mentioned she did get a chocolate basket but there was no card. I will never order from you guys for making that mistake. You are on my \"DO NOT ORDER LIST\" In my opinion, the best tasting coconut water on the market.  All of the types of coconut water I\\'ve tried have different tastes, so if you haven\\'t tried this one or many others for that matter, go to the health food store first to see what you like best before ordering on amazon (much cheaper). Sure, there not really a health food. But I love that these are soy free (it\\'s basically just sugar and chocolate). I love that I can eat some and not be worried about being exposed to the deleterious effects of soy and other junk. They\\'re great in homemade mint chip ice cream ;-) But be careful--a tablespoon has 75 calories! Tasty, tasty calories. But not a diet food. This tea is sensational and one of the best I\\'ve ever had.  I love it\\'s pleasant and fruity aroma.  I was a little concerened about the caffein, but there seems to be little effect.  I find it very calming.  A superb tea. Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch. Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. Every bag (after bag) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st!! So delicious! Tastes better than I expected for instant mix. All 4 flavors are full of warm apple deliciousness. Making this warm treat is so fast and easy and makes a great before bed drink since it is caffeine free. First off the noodles get very broken up from the packaging (probably the shipping and handling), so you wind up with nearly a quarter of a bag at the bottom in small pieces, the other problem is that they just do not have much flavor and they do not offer a great texture to the meal.  I tried to make these with some teriyaki and chicken stock, and they came out mushy and flavorless, they do not seem to absorb and flavor from the dish and they get soggy like and do not hold up after cooking.  I frequently enjoy making noodle dishes and have never had noodles that came out so bland and textureless as these did, even when cooked with intense flavor items.  I much prefer Maifun Rice Sticks, and will probably stick to them for future entrees.<br /><br />Maybe in certain dishes you can make use of these noodles, but for the meals that I like, I will have to continue to use Rice Sticks and Chinese Noodles.  My only other flaw with these noodles is that they get crushed in their packaging, and causes for the majority of the noodles to be broken at the bottom of the bag. I have 2 yorkies... both under 1 year old.  They are OBSESSED with these treats.  These are their favorite BY FAR.  (One is a pretty picky eater too, but absolutely loves these soft buddy treats.)  They have made training much easier because they will do anything to get them.  (If I train with other treats 1 of my dogs will spit it out and wait to see if I have a buddy treat...)  :)  They love all of the flavors (as long as its the soft and chewy buddy biscuits rather than the other types). My baby LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these banana Mum-Mums!  They are gentle on her tummy, dissolve quickly, and are perfect for her to gnaw on while she is teething.  I started buying them for her when she was 4 months old, and she never had a problem with them.  They are also great for her to snack on while my family eats dinner, so she can sit with up and feel included, while having something she can independently feed herself without a huge mess.  They can get a little sticky, but not nearly as much as traditional teething biscuits. I would recommend this product to any momma, daddy, or family member. I used this mix in my Waring Pro Double Belgian Waffle Maker and it made DELICIOUS crispy waffles with great flavor. I will be buying over and over again! I can\\'t speak to how it works as a pancake mix mostly because pancakes are dead to me after making waffles with it! ;) I use these to give my dogs nasty tasting pills.  It works like a charm. I loved these chips.  Even my teenager loved these things.  I only got the Salt and Pepper in my first order, but I have now ordered a variety package. I am really looking forward to trying the others. I love this stuff, my first time to order it and try it and very good it is.  I had bought this for my son but he is out of luck and mama is drinking it with him.  It is delicious. Easy to make and fast and without mess. If your looking for great espresso coffee, look no further.  I buy the whole bean and grind it at home - love it Below is directly from the product details of what I purchased.  When I received the product it was 4 x 1 x .75.  Since what I received is clearly not the same as what I ordered, I am returning the product.  If they have multiple listings of similar products, they should ensure the discriptions are correct.<br /><br />Product Details<br /><br />  * Product Dimensions: 10 x 2 x 1 inches ; 1.2 pounds I use Pelindaba\\'s lavender pepper on everything. Use it just like regular pepper. I purchased the grinder and keep it re-filled with the larger size. This makes a great gift for people who have never used lavender in cooking before. It\\'s so easy to use. I really like this tea.  I originally bought the package which comes with 6 boxes containing 18 teabags each.  When that was gone, I ordered the 100 count box.  I am told that oolong tea is good for you, so I\\'m glad this white peach type is to my liking. No more of hot sauce making your food simply just hotter and saltier. This bad boy packs MAJOR flavor! The spice is perfect and the flavor is fantastic! Try it!! This is an excellent product and I received excellent service from vendor. I received the product before estimated arrival date. I have been using Mio for a long time and enjoy it to the point of not using anything else to flavor my water, it helps get the needed amount of water everyday. I tried this product to see if I could make creamy, starbucks quality spiced chai at home and was underwhelmed.  A much better product is provided through Mocafe, Precious Divinity Spiced Chai powdered mix. I ordered these after noticing the difference in the taste of foods I prepared using sea salt. The difference is rather subtle. The sea salt has a mellower taste, not as strong, but more flavorful. I had also tasted salted caramels that had black salt and pink Himilayan salt on them, and was interested in the contrast of the salt with the sweetness of the candy. I tried the black salt on filet mignon, sprinkling it on lightly just before serving. My husband was a little skeptical about trying \"gourmet\" salts, but he was very impressed by the difference using the black salt made in the taste of the steak. We don\\'t normally add a lot of salt after cooking food and we don\\'t use a lot of salt during cooking anyway, at least not as compared to many people we know, so now when I plan to use the salt from Das Foods, we use even less salt during cooking and then sprinkle on a little of one of these salts just before serving.  This is a fun way to add a little something special to your cooking. I use these at work for treats, nice to get a larger sized bag at a decent price. No problems with the quality. They came packed in dry ice which was a pleasant surprise! I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs.\" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We\\'re talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn\\'t real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn. I have tried most of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and I have to say this one is my FAVORITE!!!  Once I start eating these almonds, it\\'s hard to stop.  YUMMY!!! Great product when they came I was hopping they would not break and when I got them I was glad to see they did not break because this was a christmas gift! after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen? because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread. Some parts of your steak are saltier than others. It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special, to my buds anyway. I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be \\'applied\\' evenly. Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered. I have tried, many different brand of Fry Fish, but they were all gross, this is very tasty with talipia. This is so good that I had to buy a 12 boxes of them, because I thought it will run out...try it :), not spicey, because my kids can eat it. This is a greasy product, but has good flavor.  The meat is soft, not too salty, and meaty.  I would buy again. I just made my first loaf of bread with this mix.  The texture is close to what wheat bread is.  This is the best gluten free bread I\\'ve had so far.  I\\'ve tried in the past using various recipes but the texture of my own mixture couldn\\'t even come close to this.  Great product. Everyone in my house loves these cookies, even my sister who is not into \"healthy foods\" A few years ago we received a gift of salt someone brought us from Hawaii.  A beautiful salt that was a pink/beige color, a great texture and size, and lovely taste that enhanced all food.  It came in a baggie...sigh.  I\\'ve been looking to replace it ever since so I thought I\\'d try this salt.  My honest reaction about this salt - I don\\'t get it.  I like the course texture of the salt.  It\\'s a bit more chunky then we like though you do feel it when you eat.  The taste?  Here it is, I don\\'t get it.  There is a critical mass point putting this salt on your food - and what we feel is that it\\'s nothing or simply too much.  I know, I\\'m giving a lot of words here.  It\\'s just that there are all these great reviews of how amazing it is.  The salt is kind of tasteless on the finger.  On food it seems to need a lot and then ICK!!!!  So my recommendation is a 3 because maybe we simply haven\\'t found the exact amount to use to create the taste everyone is raving about.  I keep trying and it\\'s either no taste at all or so over powering the food is awful.  For the price I\\'m tossing it in the garbage because it\\'s too much a pain at meal time when I\\'m trying to figure it out.  I can\\'t say it\\'s awful because maybe it\\'s us.  We are salt lovers and we buy and understand salt.  This salt?  I don\\'t get it.  And that is actually saying something.  So I guess I\\'ll take a stand and say - we don\\'t like it.  I\\'ve tried it on simple and complex food and recipes.  Too risky when time is so busy these days to have to find a balance of the amount you use.  Going back to Morton\\'s course kosher salt or our sea salt bought locally in Maine until I find that salt that matches the gift from Hawaii... I love Kauai Coffee Company! The coffee is so smooth and delicious. The cost is also very nice. The closest thing I have tasted to Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee but at $60/lb., you\\'re best bet is Kauai Coffee! Don\\'t pay more than $6.61 though. Walmart now sells Kauai Coffee for .66 cent/oz (12oz bag for $8) I used this mix to make waffles and used 2 TBL. flax seed meal in place of the egg. Added about 1/4 cup extra rice milk. This was pretty good. The flax gives it a little nutty flavor. I prefer savory toppings to sweet, so not sure if this would compliment berries or jam. Fresh maple syrup seems to compliment well. Be warned that this isn\\'t a fluffy waffle though like the traditional waffle that is soft to cut into. This waffle is pretty dense and crispy when done, but I like them that way. I prefer waffles to pancakes so I haven\\'t even used this mix to make pancakes yet. I\\'ve eaten these for a long time, and they are totally awesome, though not always easy to get hold of (they run out).  Great protein source for a busy vegan like me, plus I am a fitness trainer and workout a lot, so I need the convenient protein. Personally I think mesquite lime is the best, flavor wise, of all the Primal Strips, but they are all good.  My hubby loves the barbecue ones. I was Disappointed to find that my cheese that was hand-cut and weighed, turned out to be 7 ounces instead of the advertised 8, Over-night shipping and very quick delivery/processing time. They called me and taken care of the issue. After reading Feeding Baby Green: The Earth Friendly Program for Healthy, Safe Nutrition During Pregnancy, Childhood, and Beyond I make most of my babies food because it is exceedingly difficult to find nutritionally balanced ready-made baby food. However, I do keep a few ready made pouches on hand as back up.<br /><br />I have some gripes about modern baby food in general.<br /><br />1)Most of them are loaded with sweet carbs and are not nutritionally balanced for babies needs, but they do not reveal this easily.<br />2)They are formulated according to what babies will eat happily and costs little to produce, versus what is actually good for babies.<br />3)For babies up to one year old, the perfect food is human milk which is 50% fats, 37% carbs and the rest is protein and vitamins/ minerals. After 6 months babies need increasing amounts of protein. None of the organic \"baby food\" on the market even attempts to provide this proper balance of nutrition in their foods.<br />4)The predominance of the carb dense baby foods are directly contributing to the obesity epidemic in America. These foods are getting babies hooked into an addictive and damaging insulin cycle that gives the USA the highest rate of childhood diabetes in the world. People think that \"organic\" equals \"healthy\" and that is what the marketing from the baby food companies wants you to think. There is organic junk food too and the VAST majority of organic baby food on the market is dessert, not nutritious food.<br /><br />Having said all of that, this flavor of Baby Gourmet food is the yummiest Banana pudding I have ever had. But make no mistake, it is dessert and I only break this one out if our baby needs a little help getting started on the healthy stuff. I would never give him more than a couple bites of this in one sitting.<br /><br />Notice that the Nutritional Facts are not revealed on Amazon\\'s description or on the Baby Gourmet website! Well, scrupulous Mommies, here it is! Total Carbs 12g (with 10 grams of sugar). 0 protien and 0 fat. Thats not added sugar, it is sugar from the fruit ingredients (complex carbs) which is better than table sugar (simple carbs). However, this food is recommended for babies 8+ months and they have increased protien requirements, not increased carb requirements. Keep this in mind when choosing what to feed your children and balance out the ratios (fats, carbs, protiens) at every meal for a healthy thriving baby.<br /><br />Was this review helpful? These pretzels are wonderful.  The heat is present but not overpowering.  My 4, 7, and 13 year old kids love them.  Try using them in your \"famous name cereal\" party mix.  It makes a big difference! I have been looking for gluten free plain crackers for ages. Being pregnant, all I wanted in my first trimester was some plain crackers, but I thought I had no options being Celiac; there\\'s some nice rice crackers out there, but they all are flavored with onion, garlic, BBQ, etc- not things you want during pregnancy! I found these recently in a local (high end) grocery store and was so happy to see \"plain\". I tried them and I had to laugh at myself for getting so excited over plain crackers. They are super good, with by themselves, or with butter, cream cheese, etc. They are great for soup as they are full of flavor and have a crispy taste. They are also not high in salt like most other crackers. Great buy too, I highly recommend if you, like me, just want some nice crackers without the salty \"flavor\" added to them. Love the Haribo (see my review on their Gummi bears).  This candy is a good alternative to the Gummi bears.  I can\\'t eat too many of these without getting the \"over soured\" taste in my mouth, but this is the case with any sour candy.  I like it, but I have to use it in moderation.<br /><br />The consistency is great, the sour with the coke bottle flavor is a unique experience.  Again, you can\\'t go wrong with the Haribo line  (except for some of their weird fruit lines) Some of the reviews of this product that is.  The pineapples are excellent, and I may be ordering them regularly.  The pineapples have a nice yellow color, they have a nice fresh no-added-sugar taste, and in the pack I received none of the cans had the slightest dent. As I become more aware of the nutritional values in foods, I try to find a good balance between taste and nutrition.  Ostrim has done it with this product.  I love regular beef jerky, but wanted a lower fat/sodium snack.  At 60 calories per pack with 1.5 grams of fat and only 290 grams of sodium, I found the nutrition I wanted in my jerky.  The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it. I have now been eating this jerky for over a year and still think it is a good \"healthy\" snack for when I have to have some jerky. My son is 16 months and loves this product! It\\'s so difficult to get him to eat fruits and vegetables by themselves, but in this little pouch, which has both, he will eat it every time hands down. He loves it! And I have not found another company out there that can give your child what this one does - antioxidants, omega 3s, fiber, protein and Salba, this awesome super grain. Not to mention it\\'s all organic. This particular one is a favorite of ours because of the cinnamon. Philip loves the taste of cinnamon. As a first time mom, it\\'s great to know that I have an option out there for a tasty snack to give my son that is super healthy for him. Not to mention this on-the-go type pouch is really convenient. I highly recommend it. The Cadbury Flake bars were delicious and unfortunately they were gone all too quickly. It is a shame that they are not sold in the United States! Looks like i\\'m going to have to buy more from Amazon now :) This is the very best bargin you will find on this poduct.So if you like paying 8.00$ or more for a 3oz. can by all means go to your local market they will be happy to take your money.This is the very same as the market minus the high price. I ordered this expecting to receive, \"Lorina Sparkling Lemonade , 11.1-Ounce (Pack of 12)is a six-flavor gourmet selection\", as it states clearly in the description and shows clearly in the photo.  I received a 12-pack of one variety only.  In fact, I ordered two variety packs and received two packs of the same variety.  These people are liars and I expect them to re-ship what they say they are selling. The tast is good but it\\'s the beef jerky that has the most fat in it I have ever tasted. I gave this to my mother and my sister\\'s mother-in-law and both were very pleased with the item.  It comes beautifully packaged and the actual item is just as beautiful!  Both ladies were delighted and excited to use it.  The price made it terrific for me as well.  It was nice to find the perfect gift at a perfect price. I was fully intent on becoming a mole serial killer.  I wanted the very mention of my name to strike fear in generation after generation of the little turds.  But, to this point, the moles are having the last laugh.  The trap has failed to catch a single tunnel builder.<br /><br />The \"trap\" has sprung once in the weeks I\\'ve had it set. I could barely contain my excitement as I wrenched it from the tunnel, only to find that all it contained was a large clump of bermuda grass.<br /><br />My wife is belittling me for my purchase of this device.  I promised my young neighbor I\\'d bring her a mole, as she\\'s never seen one.  Looking over the fence and repeatedly telling her, \"Not yet\" is getting embarrassing.<br /><br />It seems the moles are on to me.  Each time I set the trap they alter their route(s).  As soon as I move the trap, they return to their old tunnel(s).  It\\'s becoming a game to both of us.  I WILL WIN THIS GAME.<br /><br />I ain\\'t giving up.  I trusted the glowing reviews of this device that I read.  Yes, I have considered that the review was written by either the inventor of the trap...or by an employee of the trapmaker\\'s company.  But I will persevere.  While my friends await the reportage of the first dead mole; while my neighbor awaits her first ever eyeballing a mole; and while my wife continues her laughing at my empty mole trophycase...I continue the battle.  I will not toss this \"trap\" into the pile of failed mole-stopping gear.<br /><br />I will report back when the first mole meets its demise. I find the skinny cappucino flavor to be the weakest of the dolce gusto capsules. While it is pretty good for a skinny coffee why does every skinny coffeee have to have a less flavor and taste than a regular coffee beverage? Surely with all of that technology they can find a way to make a skinny beverage not taste like a skinny beverage? It has a pretty good taste but I am slightly disappointed. I am so happy to have discovered Madhava Coconut Sugar.<br /><br />My family has a collective sweet tooth and we baked all the time. I used this blonde sugar in our pancakes, a chocolate cake and in my husbands tea (all without letting anyone know). Everyone loved the pancakes and the cake and no one had a clue that there was a healthier sweetener being used. My husband did notice a slightly different taste to his tea but he assumed it was the tea leaf and enjoyed it.<br /><br />I will continue to use this product. So happy to have found it. It tastes almost like those breath mint strip things that dissolve on your tongue. Just a bit stronger.<br /><br />I use two right before working out, and they give me enough energy to go through my entire 2 hour workout without feeling tired :) I used to drink coffee but switched to these after coffee started messing my stomach up.<br /><br />I haven\\'t tried the other flavors, but mint is good not bad. I recommend these to anyone who is looking to an alternate to nasty energy drinks and coffee. I ordered three different types of these grinders.  They are great, last a long time & great fresh tasting flavor.  A little really does go a long way, I\\'m watching my salt intake so the natural flavor of the garlic is perfect. Finally, great tasting, sweet, unsalted cashews! This is not an easy product to find! Buying for the 3rd time!<br />YUM!! You can get the exact same product at Wal Mart for 2.50 why would anyone pay almost 13.00 dollars for snow cone syrup?....crazy! We\\'ve been using Wellness CORE Grain-free (original) dry dog food for several years and it really shows! We began a grain free diet with one of our dogs about 15 years ago due to seasonal allergies (the vet had actually recommended going grain free). There are other really great brands of grain free out there, however, we\\'ve just stayed with Wellness CORE because it works. We get so many compliments one how our dogs have super soft, shiny coats and their eyes are clear and bright. They love their CORE and we only feed them dry. It is so worth the extra cost to feed a high quality dog food ~ grain free or not. Their bellies are full with great food ~ no additives, by products, etc. Both dogs that we originally started on CORE have since passed...but lived to the ripe old age of 17 and 19. Hopefully, our two current dogs (7 years and 9 months) will do the same! Highly recommend this food. I\\'ve been eating Chex Multi Bran cereal for several years.  They are tasty and a relatively wholesome cereal.  I actually use them as a \"condiment\" on another brand of whole grain bite-sized shredded wheat.  That one is sugar free, and these have a little sugar.  I sprinkle a just a few on top for added flavor.  A local grocery chain stopped stocking the Chex Multi Bran cereal, so I started a Subscribe and Save delivery with Amazon.  Order them a week ahead, and they are at my door when I need them. Remember those Ritz Bits you ate as a kid? Well this tastes exactly like it, only in a different shape. Ritz didn\\'t make a new innovative product, they took their same lousy recipe and changed the way it looks. While I like the idea of Milo\\'s Kitchen I found that the ingredients in the product raise some questions about the health risks to my Rottie.  There are onions and such that could cause harm to my pet so with that said I don\\'t believe I will be purchasing this item again. I own a Senseo machine and was using Senseo brand coffee for a full year before I found the Baronet coffees on Amazon. I buy this Izzy\\'s and a decaf and they are delivered to me monthly at a price cheaper than the Senseo at Target (which is the cheapest I have found for the Senseo brand). The thing that really sells this for me is the amount of coffee per pod - much more than the other pods on the market. Not all Baronet pods are this super size...be sure to check the weight. There is a good 30% more coffee in these pods than the other brands, they are delivered to my front door and the flavor is wonderful! I feed my terrier\\'s a dry, healthy dog food; however during their dinner; I mix the Pedigree Little Champions in with their dry food.<br /><br />They go CRAZY! I have never seen dog\\'s eat so fast; and then continue to lick the bowl even when there\\'s nothing left inside.<br /><br />Great buy! Great find! And Great taste! I\\'m never disappointed with the Breakfast Blend Coffee from Green Mountain Coffee.  It\\'s always fresh and makes a very smooth cup of coffee, never bitter. I got hooked on these in Hong Kong where my American candy choices were Starburst and Skittles, both sugar rushes of the extreme sort.  This candy is not as sweet as those, but a bit sweeter than most Asian candy (many of my Chinese friends find it too sweet for their taste, but many of my American friends say it is not sweet enough).  I kind of like the middle ground, trying to cut back on my sugars. These bars are really tasty - not too sweet, no artificial sweetener aftertaste.  I\\'d tried balance bars and these are way better.  I was surprised at how well they stemmed my hunger and levelled my blood sugar for several hours.  They are also large and substantial, you really feel as if you\\'ve eaten something. Our dog loves the taste of these treats.<br /><br />Pros - Taste...apparently. They appear to be healthy.<br />Cons - They are easily chewed through; thus, your dog will likely finish them quickly. There was a younger, stronger time when frowns appeared at the sight of HH, but the products have gained much more respect in the golden years so much so that my spouse can help w/cooking!  Be it meatless or w/beef, pork, ham, chicken or tuna,or just plain Alfredo, the basic contents of these products can be prepared to taste gourmet w/just a FEW added ingredients one most likely has on hand for any given meal!  For instance, Sloppy Joes w/sauteed onions and peppers served over toast points w/a salad and a fruit makes for a completely balanced meal.  Have stockpiled cases for emergencies in my safe room, as well as for daily use! Man....You mix a bag of these with a bag of \"Gold Fish\"...( Any Flavor)...and you\\'ve got a PARTY. These are the HOTTEST... BEST QUALITY PEANUTS on the MARKET . I searched all over for these after a local store I bought them at stopped getting them from their vendor . It was GREAT when I found that I could get them from AMAZON.COM . THese Peanuts are HARD TO FIND , not all vendors carry them (cuz their sissies). It\\'s easier to buy them here , might I add that they cost about $ .32 less per pack . Sorry for the Shameless plug ,but you\\'ve got my vote on this one ...<br /><br />  Dave  : ^ D Well, it\\'s really intended only for our own cat, Princess.  However, she seems to have worked out some kind of system with the other cats in our neighborhood, because I have to keep shooing them out the back door in the morning.  They love this stuff and I think Princess holds the door open for them somehow.  If I can get a good webcam set up I\\'ll catch her, eventually.  Meantime, I\\'m really glad I can get such a good price on this, and reliable delivery every month! I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days.<br /><br />I took a star off because I\\'ve been drinking it for several weeks and I\\'m not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I\\'ve always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?). My female cat who just was turning 12 this summer lost the fuction/strength of her back legs and she was hopping around (think bunny rabbit); I took her to the vet expecting to be told horrible news and have to put her down...nope. She had diabetes!  I had no idea that was a symptom of high blood sugar and high triglycerides in cats.  She was put on Insulin injections 2 x a day and I was told to stay away from dry cat food (the Vet also told me that diabetes in cats is a MAN CAUSED DISEASE! with all the by products, and grains and junk they put in those foods as fillers) and stick with a high protein low carb canned food twice a day.<br />We have another cat, a 5 yr old non diabetic male...so this meant his diet had to change as well. He was not happy when I took away all dry food.  And slowly over time, my 12 yr old started to sit at the dish more looking at me as to be saying...\"sure i can walk but i\\'m starving lady!\"<br /><br />After about a month of insulin injections and their new food routine, my 12 yr old started to regain strength in her back legs and was back up to walking on her toes most of the time, but still had a very hard time jumping on furniture or on the window sill.  I decided to add back the dry food just a small amt. a day and leave it out so they could graze when they were used to. My mom told me about this brand, she feeds it to her dogs, and said she thought they had a cat brand that didn\\'t have any grains in it.<br /><br />I was hesitant b/c of the price and some of the feedback on other petfood sites suggested their cats hated it or it was \"too strong\" for them, whatever that means. Well, let me tell you...2 days later, my 12 yr old diabetic cat was RUNNING! I am not kidding.  She is 100% up on her toes all of the time, running, jumping back up on the couch and bed like she always used to as a younger cat, loves to play \"fight\" with her younger brother cat.  The difference is amazing.  My 5 yr old male cat enjoys the food very much, and while I did try the canned variety that Blue Buffalo has to offer, they were not diggin it at all, so we returned back to the cheaper canned food they like and they get a 1/2 cup of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Dry in a bowl each morning and they just have a nibble here and there which keeps them both very  happy.  Their coats have never been fluffier and softer.  My female cat has never had soft or fun to pet fur; but suddenly I have noticed over the past week her hair seems fluffy and full and the softest it has ever been. My male cat has always been soft and fluffy, I didn\\'t think his could get any softer, but it has!<br /><br />I\\'m not saying that Blue Buffalo was a miracle that suddenly made my 12 yr old diabetic cat walk again, I realize that a change in food and insulin was a big part of that, but this definatly made a difference in her quality of life and it happened fast!  It is pricey, but have you ever looked at the back of the ingredients list of other dry cat foods???  RIDICULOUS! THis brand is totally worth it.  ESp since they are getting such a little amt. each day, the large bag will last at least a month.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this brand of food and the fact they actually sell something without grain and gluten. Cats do not need that junk!!!!!!<br /><br />I should also add that both cats seem to have nice soft, thick coats and are maintaining their weight.  My diabetic has always been obese topping off at 14 lbs, she lost 2 lbs over the past few years the Vet says prob the first symptom of her diabetes; she has went up to 13 1/2 lbs and has stayed there; which was a little of a concern when adding in this food; it is high in calories, but with all that running she now is doing up our 17 steps daily, she must be burning it off :)  Shop around for the price, I buy it in a certain well known pet store for about half of this price. I bought this coffee after reading other reviews.  I thought \"pumpkin spice\", yum!  Something similar to the taste of a pumpkin pie or coffee and pumpkin pie.  WRONG!!!!  This doesn\\'t even taste like coffee!  I shook the K-cup around prior to putting it in my Keurig machine, so as to make sure that the hot water would run through all of the coffee beans or flakes or whatever you call the chopped up coffee bean.  Fresh, clean, cold filtered water, a little pure cane sugar and a small individual serving of coffeemate (the liquid kind).  It smells like coffee, it looks like coffee, but it tastes like hot, almost coffee flavored water.  I am so disappointed. I will never buy Timothy\\'s Perfectly Pumpkin again!<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0KG5K\">Timothy\\'s World Coffee K-cups Perfectly Pumpkin for Keurig Brewers, 24 Count Box</a><br />I\\'ve gone through half of the box and there\\'s no improvement in taste.  I will try again with another brand. For several years now, I have searched for a good quality and good tasting protein drink, and was never able to find one until I discovered Orgain Protein Drink.  It does not have the awful taste of whey that every other whey protein has.  I am so pleased to have discovered the Orgain Protein Drink.  I will recommend it to everyone.  Thanks Orgain. We were excited to try this new flavor because we enjoy the variety of all the various K cups.  But... unfortunately,  neither my husband or I like the flavor.  I have to agree with another poster that it tastes burnt to me. Got my first order of these last week and have ordered four more for friends who keep raving about them! I usually buy these sort of chips at Trader Joe\\'s or Whole Foods but the price and convenience of ordering from Amazon can\\'t be beat. These chips have a great flavor to them and arrived in perfect condition. I love blue corn chips and these are among the best I have ever had. You won\\'t be disappointed! Dependable efficient service from Amazon merchant... maybe it\\'s just a chronic personality thing... am waiting for the \\'calm\\'! Of course, it\\'s just between two - everyone else gets along! They are both the same age... perhaps it\\'s \\'sibling rivalry\\'! We just moved out of the country and we were looking for an easy way to transport peanut butter with us.  This is a much healthier alternative to add to my morning protein shake. The flavor is great and it traveled well.  We just ordered more to take back with us! ****<br />Stash\\'s Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn\\'t as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I\\'ve tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and don\\'t mind a few additives, it\\'s just fine!<br /><br />This 100 count box is an economical way to enjoy this tea; however, I would try it first in a smaller quantity to be sure before you go for bulk!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />**** What a wonderful selection of fruit-tastic flavors!!<br /><br />I love drinking these teas on a cold winter day -- the fruit flavor jolts me back into the warmth of summer, even when the wind is howling and it\\'s below zero outside.<br /><br />Each fruit selection brings its own unique flavor to the taste sensation -- whether one adds sugar or not -- and of course, in the summmer, they are fantastic as iced teas-- pour the sugar in when it is still hot, for better sweetness distribution.<br /><br />And for the adventurous, why not brew a two-or-three-bag tea, add sugar, then freeze and make granita??? Yum!!! I love to make my own soup particularly in the wintertime but Campbell\\'s Select has a winning recipe in its Chicken with Egg Noodles.  The chicken, veggies and noodles are good size and plentiful.  When you have neither the time or inclination to make your own soup, this is a satisfying alternative.  It is delicious. I\\'ve tried a few different flavors of Switch and this is my least favorite. (My favorite is the cherry.) Unfortunately because I didn\\'t enjoy this flavor I didn\\'t find it as refreshing as the others.<br /><br />I quickly handed it over to my son who does like kiwi berry flavors and he did like it a lot. Of course, since it contains enough vitamin C for a whole day, I felt just fine giving it to my child, too. No preservatives, no added sugar. I like the carbonated soda product a lot, just not this flavor.<br /><br />However, the biggest flaw with this product is that it\\'s too expensive in my opinion for the little cans you get. Rounds out to about $1 per can. Less than you pay often with a vending machine but twice what you pay for a flavored water or vitamin C juice pouch when you buy them in larger quantity. Not worth it. :( BEST COFFEE ON THE MARKET FOR TASTE AND PRICE.  OTHER PRICIER HAZELNUT COFFEES (GREEN MOUNTAIN, MERLITTA, PEETS, BOSTON BEST, NEWMAN\\'S OWN, DUNKIN DOUGHNUT, ETC.) DON\\'T EVEN TASTE LIKE HAZELNUT.<br /><br />MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS WHEN THE PACKAGE WAS DELIVERED ALL 6 CANS INSIDE WERE DENTED.  NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT.  BUT THE COFFEE ITSELF, SO FAR, HAS THE BEST TASTE FOR $5.00/CAN, WHICH STILL ISN\\'T CHEAP. While no instant coffee will ever taste as good as a freshly ground then brewed cup with filtered or spring water, this is as good as it gets otherwise.  While pricey, the packets are handy and convenient, the directions are easy (just add 8 oz of hot water and stir), and the taste is smooth.  I even got a bit of a caffeine buzz.  These instant blends are not as bold or strong as getting a regular cup of columbian or Italian roast at a Starbucks location, but still a very good cup on the go.  I really like this instant coffee and will continue to purchase them. We purchased this honey to go in our vinegar/honey \"miracle\" tea... it\\'s very smooth and absolutely yummy. haha.  I highly appreciate the fact it is organic - in fact, I was looking for organic.  YS Organic Bee Farms Pure Premium Clover Honey is definitely a great buy.  This is Organic for Less...and it\\'s the best! This is one of my Austrailian Labradoodes favs and she followed me everywhere. Just break in tiny pieces if you are training. My dog tried to get out of bag. Also put a little in food toys to  mix it up a little.  My dog loves this!!! I ordered a couple different cookies from Scott\\'s Cakes. I loved every single one of them. The are homemade for sure, none are the same size, or look exactly the same, so you can pass them off as if you baked all day. I ate so many cookies, I should have been sick! They were so moist, and delicious. I will order from Scott\\'s from now on. Have been drinking Senseo Douwe Egbert Medium and Decaf coffee for many years. We even have a back up Machine just in case something fails, it never has. We pour in a dash of whipping cream, sit back and enjoy. RMB. After I got my Keurig coffee maker and tried some of the brews available in K-Cups, I thought I might have to settle for a less bold coffee.  Based on some reviews on Amazon.com I went with Coffee People Jet Fuel and I\\'ve been very pleased for a couple of years now.  I do the subscribe and save option, which is great for me and a pretty good deal (at least for K-Cups). The product arrived on time and fresh and this was the only place that I have found this tasty snack.  I would buy them again. I don\\'t like the burnt taste of Starbucks, so we ordered this coffee.  It comes out perfect on the 10 oz setting!  We are ordering more today. These are very goog ravioli. The taste is at the same time strong and delicate. Really good. Being packed in water makes this can of Mandarin Orange segments a truly healthy treat.  They are delicious and really taste like fresh Mandarin oranges.  Use them in deserts or on chicken or anything that requires a mild orange flavor.  I will buy this canned fruit again.  I highly recommend it to every one. I love my Keurig coffee maker.  I make a fresh cup of coffee every time instead of pouring a cup of coffee made at 8:00 a. m. and kept warm. About this review:<br />Let\\'s face it. Any review about foods or beverages cannot be totally objective. It is usually subjective to reflect the type of taste enjoyed by the reviewer. We all have different ways to measure what tastes good to us and what doesn\\'t. Some of us may enjoy strong coffee, while others may like it gentler. Some of us hate sour or bitter tasting coffee and others mask the taste totally by pouring so much creamer and sugar until it taste like something else.<br /><br />The Coffee:<br />This coffee has a nice aroma when open the bag. It is unmistakably vanilla flavored coffee. I followed Starbucks instructions on the bag and added 2 tablespoons for each 6 FL of water to my coffee machine. First impression was that the coffee is on the bitter side, but tastes like the good Starbucks coffee that you drink at any of their coffee shops. I added some sugar (I\\'m not a fan of masking the coffee taste by adding creamer)  and I took few sips. I decided to add a little more sugar (about 1 teaspoon per 6 ounce cup) and that tasted good to me. The vanilla taste is there. The strong slightly oily taste of a strong Starbucks coffee is all there. The next day I decided to make it slightly stronger, so I added 5 tablespoons for 12 ounces of water (instead of 4) and that seems to have all the elements I like about a good cup of Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning and you like Starbucks coffee and you also enjoy vanilla flavor, this is definitely a coffee worth considering! I have searched stores and online places for the best price on Earth\\'s best Formula.  This is the best price and free, fast shipping.  My son took to this formula without complication after I had to quit breastfeeding.  I feel better knowing that he isn\\'t ingesting chemicals and pesticides.  Since I couldn\\'t breastfeed the whole first year, I feel like this is a better alternative than conventional formulas. I received one pouch of the EBOOST Acai Pomegranate daily booster from the Vine Program. Here\\'s my take on it.<br /><br />It\\'s touted to be an energy booster and full of electrolytes, but each packet contains 20 calories and 4 grams of sugar (print is so small I\\'m reading with a magnifying glass). Each packet contains 100% of your daily needs of chromium, copper and zinc, and 143% of your daily requirement of selenium. The EBOOST blend contains 340mg of Acai fruit and green tea extract. No mention of pomegranate.<br /><br />To use: Snip the end off the pouch and pour contents into a glass with 8 ounces of water. It\\'s supposed to fizz, however, my packet did little of that. I am not a fan of colored beverages and the bright pink color was a bit of a turn-off as it looked artificial, though the packet says it\\'s from beets.<br /><br />It did not have a pomegranate taste, but it also was not a pleasant taste. It seemed as though it was flavored to hide the vitamin taste, and didn\\'t quite succeed.  Also, it comes with a warning for anyone taking prescription drugs or with a history of high blood pressure, heart problems or pregnancy, which certainly doesn\\'t sound like a health drink to me. At $1.17 per pouch, it is pricey. I feel there are far better alternatives on the market.<br /><br />I was not impressed. This is a really excellent tea with reach and subtle flavors.  It\\'s perfect almost any time of day, which is really nice. These brown rice snaps are a great cracker to eat with cheese. They are very light and crispy. These are small bits of goodies for dogs.  I find them excellent for training as they are small enough for our toy poodle to chew easily and both dogs love the flavor.  Wish I had found them years ago! Classic Movie, Loved watching it as an adult, Brings back so many memories. You must watch this movie at least once in your life. Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee... Most people think organic/natural foods have little desirable taste. These are the best granola bars I have ever tasted. Even my 3-yr-old loves them! He eats them every morning for breakfast. Came across this coffee in a hotel in Kazakhstan during a business visit. Really enjoyed it ,but it is not available in Australia to the consumer. Found it on Amazon, and now have it every morning.If you like coffee with real \"guts\" and a bit of flavour but none of that bitterness, this is the one. I actually bought this for my cat, lol. She\\'s Korean and grew up on dried squid. I didn\\'t get to try it myself as I was in Korea at the time. However, my parents said she loved it! This soup has a nice zesty flavor, very tasty for a (slightly) lower sodium soup.  It just doesn\\'t have enough of the vegetables pictured on the label.  There might be two or three spoonfuls in the entire package.  This might be a good soup to have with something else (sandwich or salad) or as a snack, but it\\'s not enough food to be a meal on its own.<br /><br />I also have a problem with this being labeled as having two servings.  Really??  Who is going to eat half of this container?  Campbell\\'s: label it as one serving.  The entire package is only 100 calories - why do you need to play labeling games?  I\\'m guessing it\\'s to try to hide the true sodium number (which is better than some soups, but still high when you consider most people WILL eat the entire package contents)  You\\'re not fooling us.  We *can* multiply by 2. This new idea Splenda has come up with seems to be more of a gimic than anything else but I guess adding \"B\" Vitamins or Fiber can\\'t hurt. I did notice a slightly different flavior in my morning coffee but not enough to be turned off by it. Now this new Splenda with added vitamins is packaged in a foil/paper wraper, this keeps it fresher and less likely to become stale or wet. I\\'ll keep using Splenda but not sure if this one is worth spending more than the standard product. I have used the generic Splenda and have to say it\\'s hard to taste the difference.<br /><br />* One other big point, the Packets are hard to open given the new foil liner, I wish they added a pull tab or at the very least score the edges so you have a starting point to help open each packet, who wants to fight with your Splenda before your first cup of coffee? Do not order from Taylor\\'s!! I placed a Christmas order on December 16th and received notice that my order was confirmed.  However, on December 21st I received another notice from Taylor\\'s stating that the item I had ordered was mysteriously \"out of stock\".  No phone call or personal apology, just a random email notice.  As a result, my Mother never received a Christmas gift from me and my family.<br /><br />I will never, ever place an order with Taylor\\'s as this vendor is extremely shady and unreliable. My brother is a chiiehead and he warned me about Blair\\'s being \\'hot\\'. Blair\\'s make a whole range of hot sauces, some of which are indeed outrageously high in Scoville units. This one however is quite good and about 6 times hotter than a Jalapeno. This is noticeably hotter than Tabasco but the flavor is similar to Tabasco. So, if you like that venerable standby but want something more, give this a try.<br /><br />Shipping is a significant cost if you are buying a small quantity. I can get this same exact product, 26 oz. at Costco for $5.99.  Why would anyone pay this price, it\\'s insane.  LOVE the product though. This is the only company I know of that makes baked potato chips from sliced potatoes, rather than from reconstituted potatoes. It makes a real difference in flavor and texture. For those new to the product, expect something more like a baked potato than like a french fry. NICE SAMPLE OF VARIOUS COFFEES.  I FOUND I LIKED MOST OF THEM.  IT IS  A GOOD WAY TO FIND YOUR PERFECT FLAVOR. YOU GET ABOUT TWO OF EACH FLAVOR.  THEY SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED A COUPLE OF JAMAICA ME CRAZY. It has a different fragrance from other cinnamons -slightly more perfume - very interesting - used it in a spice rub and it gave it extra oomph. This candy is sure to delight your taste buds.  I love it and have ordered it twice already and will order again. The recent 100 count box of Earl Grey arrived in different packaging.  The lighter, less sturdy cardboard roused curiosity about the contents.  A longer string on the bags rates as an improvement.  However, the brew tasted weaker on citrus flavor than I remember from previous batches.  Overall, I still enjoyed the full bodied flavor with a smooth finish. These are wonderful little treats, elegantly packed. A treat has to be good, satisfying with 1 or 2 bites, and worth every calorie.  These certainly are!  Crispy, light and sweet-hope Amazon carries these always. The lime essence is in the powdered sugar, so be sure to enjoy that with the cookies.<br /><br />A collection of 6 nicely packed boxes  enables you to give a nice box to a deserving friend. And these certainly are appreciated!<br /><br />Note: freshness is not an issue. I Read The Reviews First While Searching For Something To, Yes Make Similar White Chocolate Mocha Espressos....I CAN\\'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE!!!! IT IS SO YUMMY!!! It is more appropriate that my 4 basset hounds review this product.  Gypsy say Yummy! Scarlett roles on her back! Arhoo establishes Rebel\\'s opinion, and Gimme Gimme! is Dee\\'s thoughts.  I loved receiving the big bags which are hard to find at most stores on my front step.  Good quality treat and a good price. Red Espresso Rooibos Tea is marketed as a coffee substitute, and it isn\\'t.  The flavor is a passable tea flavor, but lacks the body to make it coffee-ish.<br /><br />Taken on its own merits, it isn\\'t bad.  The flavor is very similar to a black tea, but the color is a deep red.  Prepared like a brewed coffee (drip or french press) the flavor was mild compared to coffee, but strong compared to tea.  Prepared in an espresso maker, the flavor gained so character, but was very thin compared to espresso.<br /><br />Meh.  If you\\'re trying to get caffine out of your life, it might have something to offer you.  It was interesting to try, but I won\\'t order it again.<br /><br />E. M. Van Court Little dude really likes this flavor.  Wish they made a bigger squeeze tube--he usually wants a second one after he sucks the first one down.  It seems like these \"pouches\" can be nearly completely emptied (no food stuck at the bottom).  The pouch completely collapses (like a CapriSun) when it is empty. Perfection in every bite! And I know I don\\'t have to worry about weird chemicals or compromising health issues. This is the best coffee I\\'ve ever had. I think that\\'s all I need to say for this review.<br /><br />Worth the price.<br />Would buy again! First off, ordered 2 different types of these Switch drinks and they all literally have the same ingredients, albeit 1 or 2 slight differences. They both begin with : \\'Filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates\\'... What? Not to mention, the first 2 main ingredients are apple and grape-both not the \\'flavour\\' I ordered. Anyway, I rarely read labels to begin with, but for something supposedly 100% juice, I was curious...<br /><br />Ok, now for the taste, or lack thereof. It was slightly fizzy, nothing like full-blown soda, but jeez was it sweet. Like, nasty mediciny sweet. I could not finish the can. I couldn\\'t even taste what flavour it was suppose to be. That\\'s all there is to it. I am giving it 2 stars because it supposedly has 100% Vitamin C, which is a pretty much the only redeaming quality to this not juice but not soda type drink. I\\'ve tried a number of gluten free pancake mixes, these are the thickest so far. Mine turned out more the texture of french toast than pancakes, but I think adding some more liquid would help. They have a nice vanilla flavor. If you are able to tolerate dairy, I think the Pamela\\'s mix is closer to \"real\" pancakes, but for the DF this is a decent substitute. Although I do like green tea, it\\'s sometimes a bit too green for me (like drinking tea made from lawn clippings).  The white tea smooths it out and makes for a great breakfast tea.  Even with shipping the cost is still $0.50 - $1.00 less than the cost in my local store. On cold winter evening my husband and I enjoy drinking hot chocolate while sitting in front of the fire watching a good movie. This is the best hot cocoa mix we have tried yet ... it is delicious! Of course we also like to add a bit of Bailey\\'s Irish Cream, which makes it even better. YUM! Whiskas came up with a winner as far as my cats are concerned; they love all three of the \"Purrfectly Chicken\" varieties.<br /><br />The pouch it comes in, however, has to be a cost-saving thing because it is totally terrible. It is messy, and the only way to get all the food out is to dig it out with a spoon, and dig some more, and dig some more.<br /><br />I\\'d give it 5 stars for the food, and 1 star for the package. I know that averages out to 3 stars, but there is no other food that my cats will eat day after day, so one more star for that. I\\'ve been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter\\'s house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don\\'t believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans. Believe me, I\\'ve tried all of the major brands, and a good number of the smaller ones, too.<br /><br />Skippy Natural Super Chunk is, to me, simply the best in terms of taste, texture, health, and value.<br /><br />The only way it could feasibly be better is if Subscribe & Save was re-instituted! (and the prices went back close to what they were just a couple months ago) I was disappointed in the quality and size of the candies. The flavor was good, although unusual. [[ASIN:B000CQE3NM Stash Premium Moroccan Mint Green Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes<br /> (Pack of 6)]]<br />  I love this tea. I was having trouble finding it. I am very happy that I can buy it through Amazon. Love the chocolate taste with a little grass undertone - really surprised - not too sweet. Have been mixing with water and unsweetened almond milk - best results to mix with a little water first like the package says. Will be cancelling my subscription to subscribe to the larger size - totally hooked after three days! Great product! Plus another five stars!<br /><br />I bought this before as \"Hot Peppar\" Mustard, but I guess they wanted a \"hotter\" name.  No fear, they didn\\'t change the product, just the name.  The secret is Tabasco Sauce, but they do it just right.<br /><br />You never tasted Hot Dogs Better than this, but don\\'t forget the onions! After reading glowing reviews here, I ordered 3 different bundt cakes. Today I made the streusel. Adding 3 eggs and a stick and half of butter, I don\\'t consider this a mix! I was careful with directions, tested it with a toothpick. Cake looked good, but it is dry and not very tasty. Something is missing - flavor.<br /><br />I\\'ll have to doctor up the remaining cake \"mixes\", as it is too late to return them. I puchase regular soda because I am allergic to artificial sweeteners. Why is there artificial sweetener in a regular soda syrup? Brilliant.  Expensive but brilliant.  Tried this last year, savored it drop by drop.  I could not get it out of my mind but lost the bottle and label.  Just found it again buried under seed packets.<br />This can be used on mascarpone with a few walnuts, or dribbled over vanilla ice cream with grilled peaches on the side.  Or, in an orgy of extravagance,use with butter over waffles.  It\\'s unique.  Reminds one of the scent of the air during a walk through a pine forest during a dry, warm day.<br />You can make a simple syrup to help stretch it out but thin it separately at each use, not all at once.  Total yum. This is the best hot sauce I\\'ve ever had, it has a little heat but it\\'s reall focus is on flavor. Well, I read the reviews about the company not putting what was expected into the box\\'s however I figured it was just a fluke.  It may be, however I guess I am a fluke as well.<br />I received the breakfast, medium roast and dark roast.  I did not get any decaf.  I especially wanted to see what the decaf tasted like because many of them have a very weak taste.<br /><br />They have a subscription service, however if I cant trust them to pack what I ask for in a variety pack I am surly not going to subscribe to their service.  I am into customer service and sweating the small things.<br /><br />I am giving the coffee 3 stars simply because the coffee is pretty good.  If it wasn\\'t, in my opinion they would only rank 1 star.<br /><br />Too bad. Excellent quality and freshness.  Service by sales store was great, they went out of their way to  provide us with a good experience. Bar Harbor makes good New England clam chowder but this is inedible. Except for the color, it bore no resemblance to any Manhattan clam chowder I have ever seen. Our pups just love these snacks, and we feel good about giving them to them<br />too!  The perfect size and not too hard like some dog treats for small dogs!<br />I love how you can see the oats in them -- not junky, fatty fillers! This is a chocolate donut flavored coffee. It is not pre sweetened, has a great aroma and flavor. It is perfect for someone who likes it dark or likes to add cream and or sugar on his or her own. I have tried other flavors like this and this one is by far the best. This is fabulous tasting with no aftertaste at all.  Only takes a bit to sweeten too.  Will be ordering this from now on instead of all the other stevia blends.<br /><br />Highly recommend to everyone. Being a hot cocoa lover as I am, it\\'s hard to believe I\\'ve never tried Land O Lakes Supreme Hot Chocolate until I received it as part of a gift basket. I must say, it was one of the best cups of hot chocolate I\\'ve had in a long time.<br />I\\'ve tried soooo many different brands....from the most expensive to the least expensive. This ranks up in my top 3...which is a hard place to get to in my eyes (or taste buds?).<br />At approximately $0.40 a serving, this is a great deal.<br />You\\'ll find this hot cocoa rich in taste and quite creamy as well...even though it\\'s simply made with hot water.<br />Make sure you follow the instructions on the packet....6 oz. of water per packet.<br />Go ahead...try it...you won\\'t be disappointed! My dog Denali loves the Ziwi Peak food.  It is all meat and we supplement with a little people food and snacks but there is no filler and no byproducts and she eats less volume. I started using HAPPYBABY foods when my son was about nine months old.  At that time I was only aware of their frozen line.  I was SO EXCITED to hear about their pouches.  Although my son is now eating solids, I purchased some of the Stage 2 and 3 to use as snacks/fillers for other meals.  I loved the food combinations in the pouches.  An added plus, all the pouch packaging is BPA and pthlate free.<br /><br />My son loves the pouches.  I put the Stage 3 meat combos over pasta with a little cheese sprinkled on top for a nutritious, great tasting meal for my son (or the whole family).  He thinks he\\'s getting a special treat.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend HAPPYBABY products.  You won\\'t be disappointed. My dog love these chews. I give them at night to chew before bed. Does not stain carpets, and they eat the whole thing. I started buying these as a non-messy way for my picky toddler to get yellow fruit nutrition, and then we both got hooked, along with my 8yo daughter.  Fried, but still low in fat.  I don\\'t even like mangoes that much, but I love these!  This 6-pack is a great price compared to buying them individually at my local stores. These treats are the best!  I break them into smaller pieces and use as training treats.  I would recommend dogswell to anyone.  My dogs LOVE these and the chicken jerky.  I love them because they do not cause any digestive \"issues\"... We had these at a restaurant bar in Seattle, and I made a note of the name when I saw the server refreshing a tray of these.  The bottles are small, but this is good so you can finish a bottle before the peppers are no longer fresh.  These have a little bit of a kick, but aren\\'t horribly spicy at all.  Great as part of an appetizer spread or as a sandwich side instead of pickles.  Fun for something different! I always wanted to buy this food for my dog, but in the pet store it was about $20 more. Great value on an awesome dog food. Although I am a fan of Lavazza espresso, I found this blend extremely harsh with very high acidity which wreaked havoc with my stomach.  I am stuck with 9 bricks now (bought a case) and will have to find someone who really likes this blend. I\\'ve been using this stuff for around 3 or 4 weeks now.  I haven\\'t seen any visible improvements in the dark circles under my eyes.  I don\\'t really have crows feet or bags under my eyes (with or without cream) so I can\\'t say how it would work with firming the skin.  As far as minimizing the appearance of fine lines - it accomplishes that as well as any moisturizer I have tried.<br /><br />That being said, it is a wonderful light weight cream.  It has a delicate scent that isn\\'t overwhelming.  It doesn\\'t contain any perfumes, but I think it smells a bit like milk chocolate.  I also like the fact that it is a natural product and I\\'m not risking my health when using it. I absolutely loved these new cookies. They were so soft and yummy. The kids also enjoyed them. I saw them in the store also and they price wasn\\'t bad. I\\'ll be a returning customer for these. A WONDERFUL OLD STANDBY FOR GREAT SNACKING. GOTTA HAVE THEM.  YOU CAN TASTE THE CHEESE MUCH MORE THAN OTHER SIMILAR IMITATORS. I buy Fancy Feast for my oriental shorthair who has gum problems. A cat who needs a teeth cleaning has to under general anesthetic and I know of cats who have died from a dental. Some vets recommend hard food for teeth but at his last check up he had good gums. I was buying the FF locally but recently the price went up so the subscribe & save pricing from Amazon was cheaper and they deliver. I am so spoiled. I purchased this mustard from Amazon a few weeks ago.  I don\\'t think I have ever eaten a better mustard than this.  It took me a long time to get used to eating Dijon Mustard.(sorta strong at first) So I gave up on it until I saw this one for sale on Amazon.  I never in my born days thought I would ever find a milder yet richer tasting Dijon mustard like this.  It is the best I have ever eaten and I suggest this to anyone.  I made a vinegrette with this mustard right after I got it and it was soooo delish that my whole family wants my mustard.  Of course, I tell them where to find it.  I will be ordering more!!  Just wish it came in a larger amount. I cannot recommend this snack mix enough, because it us 100% delicious. There\\'s always at least one clunker in any mix, but not the Fishbowl. Six different rice crackers, honey-toasted peanuts, cheesy whales, and wasabi peas.  The rice crackers all have different textures and every single handful can be a different combination of deliciousness. Absolutely fantastic snack mix!<br /><br />I get these Fishbowls from World Market for $8, and the shipping is more than that through Amazon\\'s partner. This price is too much, but the snack mix itself is fantastic. I\\'m originally from Hawaii and now live in No. California.  No one knows about poke unless they\\'ve been to the Islands.  I\\'ve made this mix with Ahi and Salmon and it hit the spot!!!.  I also added some green seaweed which made it even better.  It truly is a taste of home for me and at least I can order this mix when I\\'m feeling homesick.  It was so easy to prepare.  I\\'m glad it\\'s available on Amazon.  Thanks!!! Very good hot chocolate.  I have tried a few different brands, and this one is the best I have tried.  Should be priced higher for the quality you get. These are the best protein bars that I\\'ve ever eaten.  It\\'s a huge plus that no sugar is added and they are gluten free.  LOVE THEM.  I\\'ve purchased them twice from Amazon and was very disappointed (both times) in the condition of the product.  The chocolate looked dull and old like they had been in Grandma\\'s freezer for too long.  Further the taste and texture were also a bit off.  My 4 and 5 year old boys love these.  They will split one before a soccer game or a mid afternoon snack. My advice is to buy them elsewhere and you will be pleased. I was introduced to Yoshida\\'s Sauce on a camping trip when a friend used it to make meatballs.  She herself had gotten it from a warehouse store where they had been giving out food samples.  I can see why she was hooked.<br /><br />In its most basic form, this is soy sauce sweetened with syrup and it\\'s delicious -- just the perfect combination of salty and sweet.  I love the versatility.  It tastes great on beef, fish, pork, chicken, and shrimp.  I\\'ve used it on the grill, in the oven, in a slow cooker, in a pot.  When all is said and done, you\\'d think I\\'d slaved all day.  Great stuff.  I keep a bottle in my fridge handy as a staple for whenever the mood strikes. I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I\\'ve also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you\\'ll see stories of how one person\\'s cat had issues, but even if that\\'s 100% true, it\\'s 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren\\'t based on someone\\'s experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I\\'m very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don\\'t listen to me, don\\'t listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you\\'ll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow. I ordered this sugar for use in a Nostalgia Electric Cotton Candy Machine.  To make the review short, it didn\\'t work at all.  We tried it three times and it wouldn\\'t create \"cotton\" even tho the sugar that came with the machine did work. This trap was a great fix for our moth problem! I put them on our kitchen counter and within about a month we had tons (maybe 40) in the trap.  They are very easy to set up and when full, just throw them away.  I think it was very affordable and well worth it for the amount of moths it caught.  I even reordered the same product again to replace the full traps. ...give this product 5 stars.  Yeah, it\\'s not Star****s, but it\\'s a quality cup of frothy Joe that will start the engine with smooth creaminess.  Plenty hot, but not a lot of coffee (don\\'t use your mammoth \"venti\" cup, unless you use 2 of each disk, and even then...), it\\'s nice to havethe option of using just the espresso disk if you need a jolt. I first bought PB2 after reading it online, and paid 10 bucks for the 6.5 oz jar at a specialty food store.  I was hesitant, having had less than stellar luck with low-calorie peanut butter products (Walden farms, better n\\' peanut butter, etc).  I also am adverse to products whose ingredients I don\\'t recognize.  But this one really, really delivers.  It has the same taste as regular peanut butter with a slightly fluffier texture. Ingredients: Roasted peanuts, sugar, and salt.  That\\'s it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />GREAT taste<br />Very low-calorie<br />16-oz package is a waaaaay better deal than elsewhere<br />Much more versatile than regular creamy PB<br /><br />Cons:<br />Needs to be mixed with water, which means another bowl to wash<br />Can\\'t eat it out of a jar with a spoon (which, if you\\'re dieting, might also be a pro!) :]<br /><br />Ways I use it:<br />Sandwiches (of course)<br />In cookies, cakes, brownies, and other places where the consistency of PB is tricky<br />With my whey protein shakes in the morning (chocolate whey powder or cocoa powder, PB2, almond or regular milk, ice, makes a reeses cup milkshake!)<br /><br />I shop on amazon almost daily and never review products, but I really, really love this one.  Very highly recommended. We normally use fruit to sweeten, but for things like vegan pancakes, french toast, and certain baked goods this is a great sweetener to replace Maple Syrup and sugar.  It has a mild taste, and according to the company it is a \"low glycemic index sweetener, so it is slowly absorbed into the body preventing spikes in blood sugar.\"  They don\\'t show the fiber content on the nutrition facts label.  That information would convince me that this statement is true.  In any case, it\\'s a great price on Amazon, lower than any wholesaler offer I\\'ve seen. The reviewer who said these were similar to vanilla fudge got it right. If you are old enough to remember it, I think they also taste a bit like penuche. Two is plenty for a serving, they\\'re very buttery and sweet and crumbley. These are not like traditional caramels- I wouldn\\'t try to make caramel apples with them. They aren\\'t that sort of caramel- they\\'re more like a hard fudge texture.<br /><br />My roommate said he hated them but I had SO MANY of them in the bag that I decided to put some of them in the food processor with some graham crackers and make a pie crust with them. I made a butterscotch pudding pie with the crust and it was roll your eyes over good. My roommate loved the pie and commented on the great pie crust. So I think some of the reason he didn\\'t care for them was his expectation that they\\'d be like a Kraft caramel or like a butter toffee and they are actually both and neither.<br /><br />So- don\\'t expect toffee or a chewey caramel with these. I think they\\'re awesome. I love these things. I know, I know...the word groat doesn\\'t conjure up images of deliciousness. Mostly it makes people think of poor people in the middle ages, but that would be one of the few times they certainly had one over on us.<br /><br />These particular groats arrived quickly, well packaged and very fresh. They will store for a very long time, but I suggest transferring them to some other more secure container for long term storage. They were just the right size and cooked up very consistently and with a nice nutty smooth flavor.<br /><br />Groats are something I tried because of the whole grain thing. I just wanted to add one thing that was more healthy to my diet. The instant oatmeal from a packet that I was eating for breakfast has about as much sugar as oatmeal and since it is pre-cooked and then sits in a packet for who knows how long, it is a far cry from actual healthy oatmeal. Enter my google search and how I found out about groats. I gave it a try and have never looked back.<br /><br />They are the whole oat with just the outer coating removed. It\\'s the ultimate in whole grain. I like mine with a packet of Truvia and a little milk. It is firm, nutty and just the right amount of fun to eat.<br /><br />Cooking them is something not everyone agrees on in terms of method. I suggest bringing 1 cup of groats and 2.25 cups of water to a quick boil in a saucepan. As soon as it reaches rolling boil, remove from heat, stir it up well and then cover and leave on the back of the stove overnight. In the morning, just heat it back up on low heat for about 20 minutes to finish the cooking process. That makes about 4 servings and you can store it in a refrigerator for up to a week. Then just dish up a serving, zap for 30 seconds and enjoy a quick breakfast each morning.<br /><br />Other additions are the traditional brown sugar, cream, butter or anything else. Recently, I expanded my use and made a delicious and savory stuffing for a roasting chicken that was to die for.<br /><br />My recommendation: Give \\'em a try! Saves my money because a dime sized amount of this stuff works for a whole meal for me (I usually use 1/2 bottle to tabasco sauce in 1 meal). This is the best tasting protein bar I\\'ve ever had. In fact, its the only protein bar I\\'ve ever liked. I purchase this cat food via Amazon Marketplace auto delivery.  The savings are amazing and I get to choose how much and when it is delivered, at a marked savings - very important since we have 7 cats and 4 kittens on our property.  They keep away the rodents so I\\'m glad to treat them to this food which they rush to when they hear the can open.  Check out this food and check out Amazon Marketplace auto delivery! this is  a herbal tea from the mellow bush. I do drink herbal teas, and like them, however this one I dislike. There was no sothing vanilla for me. When the hot water hit the tea the strong scent of Licorice came about. I still steeped and added agave and tried it. Unfortunately all I could taste was Licorice and I had to discard mine. I prefer these red rooibos teas.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027MGQN4\">Twinings Of London African Rooibos Red Tea(pack Of 20)</a><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATGHK\">Davidson\\'s Organic Tea South African Rooibos, 100-Count Tea Bags</a> My shiba pup loves these. I actually break them up into each pedal for him because he can\\'t figure out how to eat these whole yet. But he loves it and I\\'ve been giving these as an after walk treats and they\\'re great for training. I\\'m really happy with the ingredients in this treat. Fantastic.  The were such a hit.  The theme of shells, my love for the beach and was really happy with the flavor. Got this gumball machine/bank for my nephew. It was a big hit right away. The package was delivered very quickly, it\\'s just the right size--small enough to sit on a table top without taking up too much space, but large enough to hold a substantial number of gumballs--sturdily constructed, easy to get up and running, and is easy to operate. Highly recommended if you\\'re in the market for a gumball machine. I really think it lacks vanilla flavor.  The French Vanilla variety is 100% better. I will skip the regular vanilla next time. I picked up a package of Dreambones at Walgreens as a change from our usual chew treats for our two small dogs. After I gave them dreambones they ate these completely without leaving a trace behind. They never finished the other kind (Dingo)and we would either have to toss them or wait for the neighbors dog to come in to pick up the leftovers. They now beg for dreambones, snub any other kind and will not share the dreambones with each other like they would with the other kind. I found these locally only once and can not find them anywhere now. I just wish a local outlet store would carry these on a regualar basis. Ordering on line is OK, but picking them up while shopping would be helpful. Our dogs love their Dreambones!<br />Cindy Cole<br />Winfield IL Je fais mon palais<br />dans les dents<br />d\\'un palmier sec.<br /><br />Ce gout va parfaitement<br />avec la mediterran&eacute;e<br />et le bonheur.<br /><br />C\\'est une reprise<br />du calme qui r&eacute;ussit en tout. I like that these packages are just the right size for 1-2 people and that there are very few unpopped kernels.  This does taste a lot like the popcorn at the movies.  If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don\\'t!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It\\'s simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I\\'d definitely buy more if I didn\\'t have to taste all that salt! Nature Valley Sweet & Salty bars are an excellant granola and nut food bar that tastes great and is perfect for between meal snacks. Bought as a gift what a disappointment, nothing like photo. Ashamed that I was giving this as a gift. Person received it said food products where terrible. Popcorn was nasty and the chips where so salty couldn\\'t eat them. Products were way to small and price was way to high even though I did get it \"on sale\".  Major rip off and major bad food. If I could I would give this negative stars! We bought a small bag of Canidae to give it a try, as we are always trying new foods for our 3 dogs.  I normally serve 2 kinds of food for dinner and whenever we put Canidae in the dish, the dogs would always eat the other food first.  I\\'m glad I only bought a small bag.  For the price, the food should be more appealing.  But our dogs just didn\\'t like it and we were glad when it was all gone.  I will never buy again! Just as described.  Soft, pliable and durable.  We\\'ve used this for our frisbee addicted Australian Shepherd for years.  Holds up absolutely the best! I tried this pasta after viewing the Dr. Oz show.  I purchased a couple of boxes and tried it out on my husband.  He loved it!  On top of being healthy, it has wonderful flavor which is very important to me.  After trying this I purchased a dozen boxes.  I will continue to buy this product because it is fabulous.  Thanks DeBoles! All of the eggs fit together fine and stayed together.  Worked great.  Great value for what you get.  Colors were nice. This is simply the best tea that I have ever found.  The flavors are incredible when combined with sweetener and half and half. Amazon offers this tea at a great price and shipping to my door so I don\\'t have to take a chance on finding it at the store.  If you are looking for a fabulous tasting tea...look no further!  It\\'s here! I have no problem with this product, in fact I like it better than the powder. Of course I don\\'t eat much of it by itself, I put it in protein shakes and it is great. I might give me some energy or a pick-me-up to. This was the first liquid stevia I tried. I didn\\'t have anything to compare it to (other than Truvia packets, which I noted were not bitter). I thought it was ok, but definitely had a bitter aftertaste. It is great for sweetening beverages such as lemonade, etc, that already have a sour flavor. However, do not bake with it! I followed erithritol/liquid stevia combination recipes using SweetLeaf and my goods came out just awful. These bottles now mostly just sit on my shelf as a waste. On a recent recommendation, I ordered a bottle of NuNaturals liquid stevia. There\\'s a HUGE difference with the NuNaturals having basically no bitter aftertaste. It\\'s a little more expensive, but invest in something you\\'ll actually use and enjoy! Great tasting honey.. only wish it was in glass jars and came in a bigger size.. I love this for it\\'s probiotic value.. soothing in teas. We know a lot about GF producs in my house and my son really likes these cookies.  They are good Oreo substitutes.  The only reason I\\'m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cookie part is very hard and brittle. This tea is wonderful. Delightful taste of mango, you can make it stronger by adding more tea bags if strong is your preference. Add a little honey and its delicious. Had neighbors try it and they fell in love, drank my whole stash. One of my spouse\\'s favorites, even I enjoy it and I\\'m a coffee drinker! The description for the item reads \"... Large arrangement measures approximately 24\"H x 16\"L ...\"  The item I received is nowhere near that size.  In fact it\\'s smaller than what the product description describes as a \"small\" arrangement (20\"H x 14\"L).  At $94.99 it\\'s a rip off.  More expensive than a dozen roses (it only contains 8).  Combine this with the fact that it arrived a day late and I had to call 1-800-Flowers and spend 20 minutes on the phone to find out where it was.  It\\'s the last time I do business with them. We originally found these at Wally World.  When we could no longer get there, I hit the internet.  Both are quite good . . . we prefer the spicy. Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the \"glue\" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana\\'s gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana\\'s Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than \"regular\" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren\\'t cheap, and cheap cookies aren\\'t good!  Give Nana\\'s banana cookies a try.  (No, I don\\'t work for Nana\\'s but am a happy, loyal customer!) The vanilla infused Starbucks ground coffee has a delicious flavor that is a fitting compliment to the Starbucks coffee line.<br /><br />The traditional Starbucks coffee is combined with a hint of vanilla that blends nicely with the nutty coffee flavor without compromising the quality.<br /><br />This combination did seem to be a bit stronger and it took a little to adjust the amount of coffee to achieve the desired balance, but once I compensated I was very pleased with the product and will continue to stock this as a must-have core item on my grocery list. I became a fan of these Breakfast Bars quite a while ago.  Much to my dismay, I could no longer find them at any grocery store.  Guess where I found them?  Amazon.com, of course.  I am very happy to have them in my cupboard again. They are very tasty (especially warmed in the microwave).  I grab one with my coffee a couple of mornings per week. Was surprised by how sweet this sugar was.  The moment I poured a bag into my mouth I was overcome with a sweet sensation.  Extremely convenient for carrying to a friend\\'s house or to work in its individually wrapped packaging.  You can certainly stuff five or ten into your front pocket without attracting unwanted attention.  I will continue to update you on the progress I make with this sweet little package of brown ecstasy. Unfortunate that Zico natural coconut water was reformulated when this bottle was introduced. I like the convenience of the bottle, and find it easy to believe that the bottle is environmentally friendlier than the tetra pak, but the flavor of the coconut water is unpleasant--the kindest characterization I can come up with is \"flat\". Like other reviewers, I like the flavor of Zico natural coconut water available in the traditional packaging. A look at the nutrition information on the label makes it clear that there is a difference in the two products, though I haven\\'t analyzed the changes. Will not be purchasing any more of this product. I liked the look of the candy, and how you could use them like real legos, but the candy is way too hard!!!  I haven\\'t yet given any to my kids because I don\\'t want to end up with a visit to the dentist with a broken tooth!! I am completely addicted to my Chai- and I\\'ve gotten 2 friends at work hooked, as well.  We split the box I bought here, and it was less expensive ($2.21/box of 20) than when we get it by the single box in the grocery store ($2.59/box).  Definitely worth it, especially if you can get the free shipping!  Who needs coffee??!? I gave this product as a gift to some clients as a change from Dean and DeLuca...not a good idea..<br /><br />My clients loved the gift box, the crackers etc. were very good...BUT, the smoked salmon was not high quality.<br /><br />I would not suggest this item for the food, but the box is nice. Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. That\\'s a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed. My elderly grandmother needs to take in a certain amount of protein daily. We\\'ve tried every shake and food product on the market but these bbq vienna sausages seem to hit the spot! She eats a can a day and loves them! Just pop them in the microwave or on a pan on the stove for a quick yummy snack This coffee is good with a chocolate taste and a hint of raspberry.  I think anyone that loves a chocolate taste would enjoy this one. Taste excellent with mix berries and almond milk don\\'t forget the ice, also try the peaches and cream I\\'ve lost 20 pounds with this powder shake. I love Saladitos, I grew up in Tucson AZ where you could get them at any store. So now that I am away, I love that I can get them online instead of waiting till I visit to get them. This dog food has all the ingredients you don\\'t want in a dog food - corn, by-products, etc.  For about the same price, Diamond has their Naturals line that is MUCH BETTER in terms of quality.  Diamond Naturals Puppy food doesn\\'t have corn or by-products.<br /><br />I honestly don\\'t know why Diamond puts out this awful dog food when they can make quality ones for right about the same price - given the choice, who would take the one for less quality?<br /><br />Our puppy was on this when we got her, we bought a small bag and slowly changed her food to the Diamond Naturals for Large Breed puppies, and the difference is fantastic.  We\\'ll stick with the Naturals, and never have her go back to this variety. I ordered these on December 9th for a Christmas stocking gift, and was told I would receive them between the 15th and 17th.  I got a notice on the 17th that my order would be delayed and that my new delivery estimate was right before Christmas, between December 23 and 24th.  I approved the delay only to receive another message on Christmas Eve that I would not receive the seeds in time for Christmas, and that my approval was needed for another new arrival estimate between Jan 3rd and Jan 9th.  I grudgingly agreed to the delay, because I really wanted to give this gift to someone who I know loves chocolate covered sunflower seeds.  They finally showed up, a month after ordering them, on January 7th.  After waiting so long and hearing from many people that Trader Joe\\'s products are yummy, I expected them to be good.  I gave the seeds to the family member whom I bought them for, and we both tried them.  We both agreed they are edible, but sub-par.  I have had several other brands that were MUCH better.  I will not order these again. If you like chocolate a lot - you\\'ll love these truffles!!  They melt in your mouth and leave you wanting more.  Expensive but so worth it! We originally purchased this blend because my wife was a big fan of the Green Mountain French Vanilla blend, mixed with a caramel creamer.  We had hoped that this blend would have a similar flavor, but it didn\\'t.<br /><br />We\\'ve tried numerous Green Mountain blends.  This one was definitely the least impressive of the bunch (so far).  The flavor isn\\'t bad by any means -- it\\'s certainly drinkable -- but it feels like it\\'s missing something, especially when compared against other K-cups in the same price range.<br /><br />For comparison\\'s sake: Our K-cup blends so far are the GMC Breakfast Blend, the French Vanilla blend, and Gloria Jean\\'s Butter Toffee blend.  If you\\'re looking for something a little darker, Emeril\\'s Big Easy Bold blend is also very nice. I didnt like the candy at all it was like a bunch of back in the day penney candy for alote of money  will never buy a gain I know its not the healthiest snack, but there\\'s nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It\\'s even cheaper if you add it as a \"subscription\" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!! Got these chocolates for halloween.  I live in a neighborhood where children stream uninterrupted for over 3 hours.  So this is the second year I purchase my supplies via Amazon.com.  Order came on time and there was more than sufficient with all the other products I ordered. Magnesium deficiency can affect all aspects of health. I have tried various magnesium supplements, and this is my favorite. I feel, as the label says in bold letters, more CALM when I take this. There is less muscle tension in my body. I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.<br /><br />Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb. Unfortunately, this is also a sign that your body isn\\'t ABLE to absorb magnesium properly, in which case you may need to look into temporary IV or topical formulas until this is addressed. The guy who services our company K-cup coffee brewer recommended this exact brand and flavor of coffee. I wouldn\\'t say it was any better than the Diedrich K-cups that I already have (the Paradiso is good). Tullys is great, however it just doesn\\'t live up to the expectation I had after receiving the glowing recommendation. Saying that, I would re-order this product unless I can find Pete\\'s k-cups somewhere. I love this tea, but I find the new box design annoying.  I don\\'t really like the photos on the boxes and I have gotten two different types, this one and the Hazelnut one and both of them had flaps that ripped and they don\\'t stand upright like the other style did, the old style with no picture.  I don\\'t know why this is, but it bothers me enough to tell others about it.'"
