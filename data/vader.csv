They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other ""real"" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true ""chocolatey"" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there."

If ever I can't find her in the house, I just pop the top and she bolts out of wherever she was hiding to come get a treat. She doesn't like crunchy treats much, so these are perfect for her. I've given her all three flavors and she seems to like them all equally. They do tend to dry out by the time I near the end of the bottle, however. The flip-top lid is very handy. Very nice, inexpensive kitty treats. I have yet to meet a cat that doesn't just love these!"

Well, if for some reason those were too much of a mouthful, we now have Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bits. Yes, these are about half the size of the Bite Size versions. This particular one is ""Cinnamon Roll"".<br /><br />There is nothing new to the table here with the exception of size, which I is unnecessary. Personally, I like original flavor and size the best. But the Bite Size edition were accommodating. These come off as a desperate attempt to give attention to a brand that needs some sort of life put back into it and all they came up with was making them smaller and having a new flavor, which is actually too sweet for me.<br /><br />A serving size is approximately 47 biscuits. Thats 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 46 grams of carbohydrates, 6g fiber, 12g of sugar, 5g of protein and 200mg of potassium. Generally they look good but I guess those that are watching their carb intake might want to be careful.<br /><br />These probably fit on a spoon better than its predecessors in a bowl of milk, but I like the other kinds cause they snack better without the milk. But here, these small ones are easily to snack more than you should.<br /><br />I am grading this product 2 stars for 3 reasons 1) I dont think making them smaller has any reason for existing outside of Kellogs filling the shelves with more versions of something that was fine to begin with. 2) This flavor, Cinnamon Roll, is sweet and has a synthetic taste to it. 3) On the plus side, I like Mini-Wheats in general, so it saved it from being one star."

So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore."

I own a coffee pod maker at work, and I have been using Senseo's medium roast and espresso pods for a few months, but after trying Marley Coffee, I do not think I can go back to Senseo. I am not demeaning Senseo's quality, but I am certainly highlighting my preference for Marley Coffee. I will admit that when it comes to pod coffee, I do not expect much, and that's probably why I have stuck to only one brand; Marley Coffee, however, went beyond my expectations. I like my coffee strong; therefore, I recommend one pours no more than 6 oz. per pod for a strong flavor (this is coming from a person who drinks `straight' coffee; I never add other ingredients or sweeteners)). On a side note, there was no particular exotic/fruity taste to this coffee, but the overall quality met my expectations and passed the ""will continue to buy"" test. Other perks: it's organic, natural, and tasty, which, in my book, is worth the price."

If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better."

I decided to try it because for quite some time now I have purchased Morton's Light Salt to cut down on the some of the sodium I take in.  This Diamond Crystal blend is not only cheaper than the Morton's for a generous amount more, but it also taste better in my opinion.  Like the Morton's, it contains a full one third less sodium.  But where the Morton's uses the popular substitute Potassium Chloride that has a slight metallic taste to it, the main substitute ingredient in this Diamond Chrystal blend is Silicon Dioxide, which to me has a much more natural salt taste.  I prefer it over the potassium chloride, and as already mentioned, you get more for your money with this blend making it a sure deal. It took me no time at all to get used to it, and I use it in my cooking as well as in the shaker as well.  If you have trouble finding it locally, I suggest you pick it up by the case here on Amazon and you will be set for a year or more.

A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS. But back to the product at hand- would I order these again? Maybe, but I am more careful about each bean I pop into my mouth now. As a highly allergy sensitive individual, I can't afford to down bad beans no matter how tiny the black dots are."

From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder."

Koeze's puddles are by far the most amazing puddle/turtle/bear-claw candy out there. End of story!<br /><br />Puddles are a holiday tradition in my husband's family.

We've now moved on to the larger jar of milk and dark... with a few random orders throughout the year ;)  The caramel is sooo soft and delicious, the nuts are perfect, and the chocolate is a nice quality. I've never met a person who disliked puddles. The price and almost exclusively online availability aren't necessarily a selling point, but those two factors may be the only thing stopping me form living on Puddles for the rest of my life or moving into the Koeze's parking lot.  If you think I'm joking than you've obviously never eaten a Puddle.<br /><br />They can be hard to find closer to Christmas; just about everyone sells out by the 15th of December.

She seldom enjoyed that chewing exercise.  The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews are the perfect chewable treat for her now and the byproduct is brief moments of breath freshening.  It does not take the place of eating kibble and my brushing her teeth, but she really enjoys these chews and they are just the right size for a small dog of 13 pounds.  In the past, I purchased the larger size and cut them with heavy duty scissors, but these petite chews are fine as is.

I also shredded a left over jerk chicken breast from last night. I must say it was very good. The noodles went great with it. Next time I will add some frozen mixed veggies as well.

I took a shot at Community Coffee's whole-bean French Roast.  I bought a Hamilton Beach coffee bean grinder, so I refuse to buy pre-ground coffee.  Psychologically, doing so would negate the value that the coffee-bean grinder would provide to me.<br /><br />With that aside, 2 of the 3 bags of coffee that came in the package were shrink-wrapped, meaning that you could see the shapes of the coffee beans through the package since it was vacuum sealed.  The other package was loose, like you'd see at your typical grocery store. I'm pretty sure it didn't effect the quality of the brew, but it's just something that I noticed.<br /><br />Moving on to the bottom line here: the coffee tastes good, but might be too strong for some.  I'm used to good 'ole McDonald's coffee, which to me, is decent.  I like Peet's and various Sumatra blends from Coffee Bean and Starbucks, but herein lies the issue with choosing coffee: how do you know how strong a particular coffee is going to be?  A solid solution would be to rate the coffee on a scale of 1-10, 1 being weak and 10 being super-strong.  In using this guideline, I'd rate this coffee a 10 in terms of strength.  It's great early in the morning when you need a quick jolt of caffeine, but not-so-good in the afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Anyhow, this was worth a shot...I plan on ordering more Community Coffee, just a weaker blend."

I was pleasantly surprised! No, it does not taste as good as peanut butter, but considering it has 85% less fat, it is pretty darn good! I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to find substitutions to stick to my points. 2 tbsp of PB2 is equal to 1 Weight Watcher's Points Plus point. 2 tbsp of full fat peanut butter is 5 points. However, 2 tbsp of PB2 does not equal 2 tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about 3 tbsp of PB2 to get 2 full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me.

I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup."

I cook with fresh herbs regularly and thought that I would give this a shot.  Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.  I had no other problem with clumping throughout the life of the product.<br /><br />The Italian blend had a nice, bright flavor. The chlorophyll was still present and strong.  Again, no substitute for fresh but better than using dried herbs when the recipe calls for fresh (it's great in sauces, by the way.)  However, if a recipe calls for dried herbs you will need a lot more of this mix since fresh herbs are not as concentrated as dry.<br /><br />I have not used this company's other products but I plan on buying them sometime in the future and I will update this review then."

Pretty happy with the taste of traditional crackers (I can eat a lot of them without toppings). Just starting to explore the crispbread space (after reading about it in a health magazine), hoping for a healthier snack, especially something lower in sodium. I tried Ryvita (can't remember what flavor, but it is the sodium free one), and it tastes like cardboard. I couldn't find Finn Crisp at any of my local stores. So I ended up ordering it from Amazon, for a pack of 9. I was brave enough to do that because of all the good reviews.<br /><br />As soon as the shipment arrived, I made everyone in my family try one. Thumbs down from everyone, including myself. Makes me wonder why the magazine people say this crispbread can go topless, and why pretty much everyone who wrote a review think this stuff tastes good. To me, it has a faint bitter taste; to some of my family, it is tasteless. I can eat it, but certainly not something I can say I like. So spending 40+ mg of sodium per slice on this is not worth it.<br /><br />Well, I think I will go back to the cardboard taste Ryvita. At least it is sodium free, and I can buy just 1 box from a local store, not a pack through mail order. Personally, I prefer the cardboard taste to this faintly bitter taste."

I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product.

Fructose is metabolized directly by the liver, which is different from other sugars, and can lead to fatty liver deposits. High fructose intake has also been linked to weight gain, insulin resistance, and heart disease risk in animal studies.<br /><br />Also, at the Amazon price this is extremely expensive.

I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this."

Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually.

One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order."

We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out. At first she barked at it since she was frustrated that she could see and smell her kibble but couldn't get to it. After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope, she caught on. Now it takes her 20 minutes to eat her 1.5 cups of kibble inside.<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- Durable and easy to wash Nalgene type material<br />- ""Rope"" is actually a flexible rubber stick, making washing/sanitizing easy<br />- Screw-off bottom makes loading up the toy simple<br />- Translucent bottle so you can see how much kibble is left<br />- Can hold all sorts of sizes of kibble<br /><br />Challenging Feature:<br />- It can sometimes take a few tries to get the bottom screwed back on b/c the threads are narrow. But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it. These were the kinds that we impossible to clean as well.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product. So does Roxxee, our dog, who still finds eating to be a fun activity."

I searched though Google, eBay, and Amazon till I found this product. It actually reminded me of a similar brand I used to buy in a Gourmet Giant Supermarket. While searching I was reminded that caviar ranges dramatically in price from thousands of dollars to less than ten for a few ounces. A friend recently told me about a cruise ship locker that held over a million dollars worth on every cruise! The best caviar I ever tasted was at a 5* Marriot hotel in downtown Copenhagen. I ordered their caviar salad appetizer every day during a week long business trip. So with that background in mind for me this product was well worth the $30 some odd dollars I spent with shipping to receive 4 3.5 ounce containers. I even purchased some fancy crackers, and real cr&egrave;me fresh to go with it. I prefer small black caviar to other varieties, and while this purchase wasn't the tastiest I have ever had, it satisfied my craving and more. By wife also enjoyed this treat and complained when I emptied one of the containers before she had her ""fair share."" I would buy this product from this vendor again, but I also plan to compare it with what others have to offer. I would be curious to hear what others have to say about where to get low cost high quality black caviar. Thanks!"

Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy.

Almond butter is a much healthier than Peanut Butter especially this brand and another brand I ate which only contain a few ingredients.  FYI for those who like Peanut Butter Justin's brands are just as healthy as their Almond Butters.  I wanted to try the squeeze packs because the other brand I have eaten in the past though good, it's such a pain to have to stir this huge jar of it every time and I like to keep an eye on my calories so having to measure out a serving from a jar each time gets messy plus it's so bland I always add a little honey to it.  This was was perfect not bland like plain Almond Butter, but not too sweet or salty just enough of everything.  Besides the convenience of not having to stir and measure from a jar I like knowing exactly how much I am getting plus these can be thrown in my purse when I go out for a quick healthy snack when I am out.  Being Gluten, Corn, Soy & Diary Free (among a few other things) makes its difficult when out so it's nice to be able to have something with me that I know is healthy and I am allowed to have."

I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.

That combination of vegetables, sauce, some sort of meat (normally chicken), and fried rice does the trick!<br /><br />I also use this rice when I use my slow cooker.  It is useful to have some sort of base to absorb the excess liquid from the slow cooking process.  Rice does the job very well--and this is one of the rices that I depend on when doling out the crock pot dish into the serving dish for my family.

I turned to Amazon, my reliable source for so many things... and there it was. I like this product although it took a few days for my dog to accept the new taste (but he's finicky). Now he eats it with no fuss. I have to give him a lot more than the recommended dose, about two heaping teaspoons per feeding, and I make sure he poops every morning at the same time and at night at the same time. I also cut back on his dog food in general, which is good quality, and I make sure he gets exercise. Now he is regular and all is good! I credit Nummy for saving my dog's life. Thanks Nummy-makers!!"

While still high, the sodium for the can is 920 mg: much less then in a ""regular"" soup.  The satisfying taste belies the 140 calories and only 2 g of fat! The liquid is light, but there is lots to chew on in the bowl: many chunks of meat and firm veggies make this a meal, rather then a snack. The ring on top of the can makes it easy to open. You can tuck a can in your purse and take it along to the office for a quick lunch. So far, so good.<br /><br />The only downside is the price. Even though I ordered the soup thru the Subscribe and Save programme, I paid for the dozen more then $6 over the price in the local mass retailer.

The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings."

The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so ""out of this world""? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO"">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee.

I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!"

I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it.

That's not a problem with this product, it's just what happens when you haven't had carbonated drinks in years.

It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.  Oh, it's also healthy and stuff.  Lots of fiber.<br /><br />I highly recommend the hearty rye.  Buy a few cases now to prepare for Y2012 :)"
